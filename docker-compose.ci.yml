# CI-specific overrides for docker-compose.yml
# ES 8.x requires proper ownership of its data directory, which is problematic
# with bind mounts in CI. Use ephemeral storage instead (no data persistence needed).

services:
  newsblur_db_elasticsearch:
    volumes:
      # Remove the data volume - use ephemeral storage in CI
      # Keep only the config file
      - ./config/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml:/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml
