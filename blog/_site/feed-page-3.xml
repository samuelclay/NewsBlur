  <li>Support for more types of alt/title text on images</li>

      <![CDATA[<p>What would an RSS news reader be without its own RSS feeds? It’s be a pretty lonely reader is what.</p>

<p>NewsBlur now supports RSS feeds for each of your folders. Just right-click on the folder, go to Folder Settings, and behold:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/folder_rss.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>These folders keep track of sites you add and remove from them. They also allow you to filter out stories you don’t want to read or even choose to only show the stories you have in focus.</p>

<p>All of your feed subscriptions in the folder, including subfolders, are merged into a single river of news in RSS format. Technically we use Atom 1.0 format for NewsBlur’s many RSS feeds, but I’m not choosing a side here.</p>

<p>The Folder RSS feeds join the Shared Stories RSS feeds and the Saved Story Tag RSS feeds that you can already use if you are a premium subscriber.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>YouTube, owned by Google, deprecated their v2 APIs on April 20th, 2015, which means that RSS news readers can no longer watch for new videos. What a bummer!</p>

<p>Except it’s not at all a big deal because here at NewsBlur we’re making sure that your videos keep coming in. Previously <a href="https://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur/topics/youtube-eliminating-support-for-rss-atom">enterprising users setup hacks and workarounds for the API</a>, which was a somewhat tedious solution as you had to update each feed and prone to breaking in the future.</p>

<p>But there’s good news today because NewsBlur now has a custom-built solution for YouTube videos. All of your existing YouTube RSS feeds are automatically ported over to the new YouTube video fetcher.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/youtube%20fetcher.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And that’s not all. The improved YouTube video fetcher now displays a big embedded video so you can watch the video right in NewsBlur.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/youtube%20detail.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To subscribe to new YouTube channels, just enter in the URL of the channel in the Add Site popover.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/youtube%20subscribe.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When Google takes away your tools, NewsBlur builds them better than before.</p>

    <id>https://blog.newsblur.com/2015/03/13/bigger-story-previews-with-the-new-grid-view</id>
    <content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.newsblur.com/2015/03/13/bigger-story-previews-with-the-new-grid-view/">
      <![CDATA[<p>There are currently three ways to read stories on NewsBlur:</p>

<ul>
  <li>List view: every story is a single line and read inline</li>
  <li>Split view: two panes of stories, one for story titles and the other for story content</li>
  <li>Full view: every story is fully expanded and ready for reading</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these views has its own benefits and drawbacks, and each of these views can be further customized. The Split view, for instance, can place story titles on top, below, or to the left of the story content. The Full view can auto-truncate stories so that you only see a couple paragraphs at a time so long stories don’t overwhelm you.</p>

<p>Today I’m launching a new view: the Grid view.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/grid%201.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Grid view is half-way between the Full view and the List view. It provides big previews of the images from a story as well as several lines of content. It’s not as overwhelming as the Full view and it doesn’t force every story on a single line.</p>

<p>You can also customize the Grid view to only show as many stories per line as you like.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/grid%202.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Choose between 1, 2, 3, or 4 stories per line, or stick with automatically scaling the number of stories based on how wide your browser is.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/grid%203.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Grid view is perfect for sites and folders that contain a lot of images. And because you can now preview a larger part of the story, it makes sense to add a new preference that allows you to mark stories as read as you scroll without having to open up the story.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/grid%204.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>However, the Grid view is not perfect for all feeds. That’s why I’m introducing another big change today. The four views are now saved on a per-feed and per-folder basis. You can choose a default layout in Preferences, but each feed/folder overrides that preference.</p>

<p>This can become a bit complicated if you have a lot of overrides and want to instead just reset all of your layouts. So you can now reset both layouts and views for all feeds and folders right from the Preferences dialog.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/grid%205.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I hope you enjoy this new story layout. And as always, tell your friends about NewsBlur. World of mouth is killer and it’s how NewsBlur is able to be a success.</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.newsblur.com/2015/01/07/organize-your-subscriptions-with-the-new-organizer/">
      <![CDATA[<p>The beauty of NewsBlur is that you can start off with only a handful of subscriptions and naturally work your way up. This is actually the reason that free accounts cut off at 64 sites. When I started building NewsBlur in 2009 I only subscribed to 42 sites. Nowadays it’s closer to 200 sites.</p>

<p>Because NewsBlur makes it so easy to pare down individual stories with the intelligence trainer, you can follow more blogs without feeling overwhelmed. But that also leads to oversubscribing to sites that just don’t publish anymore. Or even subscribing to sites that publish too often.</p>

<p>Launching today is the Organizer. This organizer helps you identify sites that may be posting too much or too little and then gives you the power to move and delete them all at once. Sure, you can do this one-by-one, but that takes time, and only in the new Organizer is everything right in front of you.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/organizer.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can sort sites, both in and out of your folders, with the following orders:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By name</li>
  <li>By number of subscribers</li>
  <li>By frequency of updates (stories per day)</li>
  <li>By last story posted</li>
  <li>By the number of times you’ve opened the site</li>
</ul>

<p>You can multi-select sites and move/delete them in one single batch edit. You can even move a bunch of sites to a new folder that you can create right in the Organizer. This makes moving sites around so much easier. You can even click on the folder title to select every site underneath that folder.</p>

<p>Try out the new Organizer and let me know how it works. And go hog wild because you will be emailed a backup of your sites after you move or delete anything. You will only be emailed a backup a max of once per day, as to not overwhelm you when you’re making a bunch of edits.</p>

<p>Here’s the full list of new features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Search feeds and folders.</li>
  <li>Fixing rotation issues so you can watch a video and rotate without losing position.</li>
  <li>Saved story tagging: add and remove tags with a handy tagging popover.</li>
  <li>Native controls for sending a story to other services (mail, safari, chrome, evernote, instapaper, etc).</li>
  <li>Progress bar for the Story view when loading a story using the in-app browser.</li>
  <li>Further UI cleanups and memory fixes/speedups for iOS 8.</li>

      <![CDATA[<p>This is a huge release for the NewsBlur Android app. So much has happened in the last six months. We’ve had a big backend rewrite that makes the app feel like new. It’s faster, which is necessary to make the new offline reading feature really shine. Now you can read on your Android phone or tablet while on the train, underground, or just in airplane mode to save battery.</p>

<p>Better yet, not only can you read while offline, but you can better read at night with the new dark theme. Take a look.</p>

<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1920" data-orig-width="1200" data-orig-src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/android%20v4.png"><img data-orig-height="1920" data-orig-width="1200" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/android%20v4.png" /></figure>

<p>Here’s what’s new in version 4.0:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Offline reading and story syncing. Stories read while offline will sync as soon as you’re back online.</li>
  <li>Option to also store images from stories for offline reading. They do take space, though.</li>
  <li>A dark theme for reading at night.</li>
  <li>The Text mode can be set to automatically fetch, so you can get to the full text quicker.</li>
  <li>An option to mark stories newer than a story as read.</li>
  <li>Major backend improvements for faster story loading and transitions. This app should feel like new.</li>
</ul>

<p>The NewsBlur Android app is a <a href="https://www.newsblur.com/android">free download</a>. And as always, there’s more big ticket features coming soon for Android.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Modern browsers are taking your privacy and security seriously with new restrictions for sites that use https. You can choose to use NewsBlur over https, which will encrypt your communications with NewsBlur and prevent eavesdroppers—hackers, the government, other people on the same wireless network as you—from seeing what you see. While that’s not necessary for everybody, SSL/https is a priority for some and NewsBlur supports this beautifully.</p>

<p>However, what modern browsers like Chrome and Firefox do is not allow you to embed an insecure http-only site in an iframe from a secure https site. That means that the Story view in NewsBlur does not load a thing for many users who are reading NewsBlur over an https connection.</p>

<p>Today I’m launching a fix for this. It’s not perfect, but this will allow you to still get at some of the content while getting around the https-only issue. This feature will proxy http-only sites in the Story view, resulting in a hacked-together but workable view of the original story.</p>

<p>At best, the Story view will look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/Story%20Proxy%20view.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>At worst, the Story view will look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/Story%20Proxy%20view%20truncated.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>While it’s not ideal, it’s a whole lot better than a blank page. Let me know how this new proxied Story view works for you. And if you want it to work flawlessly and are willing to use an unencrypted connection, just use the http version of NewsBlur instead of the https version.</p>

<p>NewsBlur is more than just a website. It’s a daily link to the far away world. This t-shirt captures the essence of NewsBlur’s appeal. For those days when you’re planing adventures and reading about what’s happening where you’re not, NewsBlur is your guide.</p>

<p><a href="http://teespring.com/newsblur2014">Buy the 2014 NewsBlur t-shirt for only $16.30</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike Teespring’s preview, the graphics on this t-shirt are crisp. And this t-shirt is being sold at cost. Also know that this is a premium blend t-shirt. That means it’s a bit stretchy and will make you look pretty good in a t-shirt. It will look great today and for years to come. Well, at least one year to come. If you wear this t-shirt as often as I’m planning to, it may only get a couple good years and then will have to come out only for special events. But then 2015’s NewsBlur t-shirt will be there for you.</p>

<p>This year’s t-shirt is designed by <a href="http://meg-draws.com">Meg Robichaud</a>.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>So many things can go wrong and often do, but I spend a good third of my time working on infrastructure, monitoring, and analytics so that they don’t.</p>

<p>Here’s what happened: At approximately 4:30pm PT feed fetching ceased. The feed fetchers were still working, which is why my monitors didn’t fire and alert anybody. But I have a second large Mongo database server used exclusively for collecting data about feeds being fetched. There are approximately 75 servers dedicated to feed fetching. These analytics look at average fetch times on a per task server basis. I use these analytics to ensure that my task servers are humming along, as they each use a ton of network, cpu, and memory.</p>

<p>This Mongo analytics servers works in a curious way. If you right-click on a feed and go to Statistics you’ll see the feed fetch history for a feed, stretching back a hundred fetches if the feed has had any issues in fetching. I keep these statistics on an analytics server separate from the regular Mongo server. I do this so that if the mongo analytics server goes down, everything will operate normally.</p>

<p>But the mongo server didn’t go down. It merely gave this error:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>OperationError: Could not save document (Can't take a write lock while out of disk space)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Mongo continues serving read queries while not allowing write queries. I didn’t plan for that! And it gets worse. The way MongoDB stores data is that is just keeps growing, even as you delete data. NewsBlur only saves the last few fetches, but deleting old fetches doesn’t give you back any disk space. Every other database server I use has an autovacuum process that takes care of this maintenance work (PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, but not MongoDB). It’s unfortunate that this is yet another instance of MongoDB being the cause of downtime, even though the fault lies with me.</p>

<p>The server that is meant to only be used to ensure things are working correctly was itself the culprit for feeds no longer being fetched. This is the ironic part.</p>

<h6 id="newsblurs-developer-during-happier-times-wearing-the-2013-newsblur-t-shirt-in-big-sur">NewsBlur’s developer during happier times wearing the 2013 NewsBlur t-shirt in Big Sur</h6>

<p>Now comes the painful part. On Wednesday morning (yesterday) I packed my car and headed down to Big Sur to go backpack camping for the first time. I’ve car camped plenty of times, but I felt confident enough to pack my sleeping bag and tent into a big bag and head ten miles into the woods of coastal California.</p>

<p>I headed out, away from cellular service, at 4pm PT, half an hour before the analytics server ran out of disk space. And then returned nearly 24 hours later to a bevy of alarmed tweets, emails, direct messages, and a voicemail letting me know that things were haywire.</p>

<p>But the real problem is that I set a vacation reply on both my personal and work email accounts to say that I’d be out until September 3rd. Now, I hired a firm to watch the servers while I’m at Burning Man starting this Saturday. But I figured I could get away with leaving the servers for twenty four hours. And I neglected to tweet out that I’d be gone for a day, so theories cropped up that I was injured, dead, or worse, ignoring the service.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/Brittany%20in%20Big%20Sur.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h6 id="brittany-newsblurs-developers-girlfriend-can-handle-any-situation-including-driving-a-hysterical-developer-three-hours-back-to-san-francisco-without-breaking-a-sweat">Brittany, NewsBlur’s developer’s girlfriend, can handle any situation, including driving a hysterical developer three hours back to San Francisco without breaking a sweat.</h6>

<p>If you’re wondering, I think about NewsBlur first thing in the morning and last thing at night when I check Twitter for mentions. It’s my life and I would never just give up on it. I just got cocky after a year and a half of nearly uninterrupted service. NewsBlur requires next to no maintenance, apart from handling support requests and building new features (and occasionally fixing old ones). So I figured what harm could 24 hours of away time be? Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>If you made it this far then you probably care about NewsBlur’s future. I want to not only assure you that I will be building better monitoring to ensure this never happens again, but to also offer anybody who feels that they are not getting their money’s worth a refund. Even if you are months away from payment, if you aren’t completely satisfied and think NewsBlur’s just about the best thing to happen to RSS since Brent Simmons released NetNewsWire back in 2004, then I want to give you your money back and let you keep your premium account until it expires.</p>

<p>I would like to also mention how much I appreciate the more light-hearted tweets that I read while on the frenetic three hour drive back to San Francisco from Big Sur. I do this for all of your happiness. If I did it for the money I’d probably find a way to juice the data so that I could at least afford to hire an employee. This is a labor of love and your payment goes directly into supporting it.</p>

<p>I use this to mute craigslist feeds that I no longer want to see in my unread stories list, but I want to keep just in case I need to perform a specific craigslist search without having to go through the whole process of recreating the RSS feed.</p>

<p>It’s also useful for subscribing to high volume sites and only reading them when you want to know what’s happening but without having to remember to re-subscribe. Such a simple feature but with a ton of utility.</p>

But instead of just allowing you to search by site, I created a new view that you can now use to see stories saved by site.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/saved_stories_view.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The neat thing about this new view is that it works for folders, too. If you click on a containing folder, you’ll see the saved stories from all of the sites inside that folder. And thanks to last month’s full text search, you can search all of these saved stories.</p>

<p>And you should expect that these features will eventually make their way to iOS and Android.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Last Summer <a href="http://blog.newsblur.com/2021/06/21/2013-07-30-simple-search-for-feeds-saved-stories-and-blurblogs.html">Simple Search was launched</a>, giving you the ability to search a single feed at a time. Obviously not ideal, but it was far less effort than the big enchilada: full text search across every site you subscribe to. It took a few months to come back to attack the full problem, but that means I could also take the time to do it right.</p>

<p>Full text search works just like the old simple search did. Open a folder or site and search at the top of the screen. Results come back instantly as you type. And this will automatically search in story titles, full text content, authors, and tags.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/search%20screenshot.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Because you’re searching for a story, hidden stories are also shown in the results, albeit with a red unread mark (as shown above). Also, in order to handle the demands of full text search, the first time you perform a search the system will index all of your feeds, which can take a couple minutes. It’s a one time process and you will see a progress bar that will update automatically when finished.</p>

<p>Since this was one of the most requested features since day one, I’m now looking to decide on the next big feature. There’s a few big ones to hit: an organizer that surfaces inactive feeds that no longer get read, a discovery platform that helps you find users, stories, and feeds related to what you like and what you may not even know you like yet, and porting many of these web-only features to Android and iOS.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>NewsBlur has a <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/api">free and open API</a> that all of the native mobile apps and website are built on. But the API is not just for official apps. Numerous third-party developers have built apps on the API and today I’m proud to announce a new native iOS app has launched with NewsBlur support.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/unread_app_screenshot.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://jaredsinclair.com/unread/">Unread</a>, by <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredsinclair">Jared Sinclair</a>, is a unique RSS reader, with a focus on simplicity and cleanliness. Sinclair built Unread because he wanted to see a different kind of reading experience, one where he could focus more on reading well written stories than consuming lots of content. Unread app has a different feel than any other news reader I’ve seen and I think many of the choices made by Sinclair work in a quiet harmony.</p>

<p>In Sinclair’s own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most RSS apps are patterned after email. Noisy parades of dots, dates, and tags trample over their screens. Their source lists look like overflowing inboxes instead of stately tables of contents. Toolbars bristling with options obscure the text. Putting it bluntly, using these apps feels like work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NewsBlur’s native iOS app certainly does fit this description. And if you want an incredibly well-made alternative, look no further than Unread, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unread-an-rss-reader/id754143884">available on the App Store</a>.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>This is not just any font and style manager. You now have control over font size, line spacing, story layout, and type faces directly in the reading view. This nifty popover gives you quick access to all of these customizable features.</p>

<p>The type faces come from <a href="http://www.typography.com">Hoefler &amp; Co.</a> (née Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones) which is the premier web type foundry. It’s also one of the most expensive, but that’s where the incredible font quality comes from.</p>

<p>The four new fonts are:</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>In this industry, you gotta be tough.</p>

<p>I’m just kidding. We’re a bunch of literates who enjoy reading so much that we built our own news readers. But when a behemoth like Google makes a call that places you at the business end of 100,000 frantic power users, reminding yourself how tough you are is one way of dealing with the madness.</p>

<p><a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html">Google announced Reader’s sunset at 4pm on March 13th, 2013</a>. At that point I had spent three and a half years building my vision of a better news reader. I clearly wasn’t doing it for the money, since my paltry salary didn’t even cover my market rate rent in San Francisco. RSS was a decidedly stupid technology to piggyback off of to try and cover that financial disconnect.</p>

<p>Take a look at this graph. It shows NewsBlur’s income versus its expenses for the past 16 months. Just look at those few months before the Google Reader shutdown announcement in March 2013.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/2013%20revenue.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It was never hard to justify to others why I worked on a news reader for three-some years, partially because I’d been justifying it to myself for so long. I had the delusion that it would all work itself out in the end, so long as I kept pushing my hardest and shipping features users wanted. And, at the time, with 1,000 paying subscribers, it certainly felt like I was getting somewhere.</p>

<p>If you’re curious about why expenses are so high, think about what it takes to run a modern and popular news reader. This graph breaks down expenses for an average month from the past year.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/2013%20expenses.png" alt="" /></p>

<h6 id="why-spend-all-that-money-on-subcontractors-and-new-tools-because-im-investing-in-building-an-even-better-news-reader">Why spend all that money on subcontractors and new tools? Because I’m investing in building an even better news reader.</h6>

<p>Fast forward a year and let hindsight tell you what’s what. I was irrational to think that I could make it on my own in a decaying market, what with all the air sucked out by Google. But that three year hallucination kept me persevering to build a better product, which positioned NewsBlur well as a strong candidate for a Reader replacement. When the sunset announcement dropped, it didn’t take long to fortify the servers and handle all the traffic. NewsBlur permanently ballooned up to 20X the number of paid users. People flocked to NewsBlur because it was among the furthest along in creating real competition. As we say on NewsBlur, <a href="http://popular.newsblur.com">the people have spoken</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-post-google-reader-landscape">The post-Google Reader landscape</h2>

<p>I run a very opinionated news reader. If you think somewhat like I do, you couldn’t be more pleased with the direction NewsBlur goes. But this is still a power tool, and in a world of casual readers who don’t care where their news is coming from so long as it’s in their interests and matches their biases, NewsBlur is the coffee equivalent of the AeroPress. Most people want drip coffee and they don’t bother wasting mental energy on caring about the difference in taste or quality. It’s a binary to them: coffee or no coffee. There’s nothing wrong with that, they just choose to focus on other things more important to them than the sourcing or control they have of their coffee.</p>

<p>Many competing news readers are visual and offer a similar experience. When you want to give up control in exchange for the digested output of sophisticated and heartless algorithms, they’re your best bet. When you want to exert control and know what you want and from which sources, NewsBlur is the only option. No other reader gives you training, statistics, and sharing in one multi-platform app. Nobody else cares so much about RSS as to work on a news reader when it was still a financial inevitability of failure.</p>

<h2 id="future-work-on-newsblur">Future work on NewsBlur</h2>

<p>If the past is any indication, NewsBlur is going to continue to see many more improvements. This graph of contributions from the past 365 days shows my level of unwavering dedication.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/samuelclay"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/2013%20contributions.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<h6 id="one-way-people-speak-is-by-committing-code-to-newsblurs-github-repo-try-developing-your-own-pet-feature-ill-even-do-some-of-the-hard-work-for-you-so-long-as-you-give-it-a-good-try-and-submit-a-pull-request">One way people speak is by committing code to <a href="http://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur">NewsBlur’s GitHub repo</a>. Try developing your own pet feature. I’ll even do some of the hard work for you, so long as you give it a good try and submit a pull request.</h6>

<p>Meanwhile, I’m using the windfall to develop a secret project that will complement NewsBlur in a way that hasn’t been tried before with any reader. And if that fails, I’ll find an even better way to make my users happy with their purchase. If you thought I was relentless before March 13th, 2013, just wait until you see what I’m capable of with the finances to build all the big ticket features I’ve been imagining for years.</p>

<p>And while you’re here, do me a favor and tweet about NewsBlur. Tell your followers, who are probably looking for a better way to read news, about how much you rely on NewsBlur. Reading positive tweets about NewsBlur every morning (and afternoon and evening and before bed) make this the best job I’ve ever had.</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.newsblur.com/2014/03/10/newsblur-ios-40-features-a-new-dashboard/">
      <![CDATA[<p>Today marks <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/ios">the release of version 4.0 of the NewsBlur iOS app</a>. To illustrate the significance of this release I’d like to talk about where the app has been.</p>

<p>The first version of the NewsBlur iOS app was actually just an iPhone app. It <a href="http://blog.newsblur.com/2021/06/21/2012-01-16-2011-year-in-review.html">launched in October 2011</a> and only allowed you to read your feeds individually. Within months the river of news (reading by folder) was added, along with better sharing controls, intelligence training, sharing to your blurblog, and the May 2013 re-design.</p>

<p>But similarly to the web, I wasn’t particularly proud of the app until I hit a major milestone. On the web, I hit that milestone with the May 2013 re-design. In <a href="http://blog.newsblur.com/2021/06/21/2013-05-20-the-newsblur-redesign.html">the blog post announcing the wide ranging re-design</a>, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not to say that NewsBlur was ugly before today, but it certainly didn’t have the loving embrace of a talented designer. So without waiting another moment (or month) I proudly present the NewsBlur redesign.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fast forward to today where I am finally releasing an iOS app that I’m proud of. This one comes with a ton of great features, both for iPhone and iPad.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios%20v4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>&lt;table style=”margin: 0 auto; padding: 0; width: 600px”&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios%20v4%20-%202.jpg" alt="" />&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios%20v4%20-%203.jpg" alt="" />&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</p>
<ul>
  <li>New dashboard for the iPad app: All Site Stories are now on the dashboard for easy access to stories. More to come with this new dashboard.</li>
  <li>Tons of new gestures: double tap, 2 finger double tap, long press.</li>
  <li>New gestures for the iPad app: swipe to dismiss the original story view.</li>
  <li>Brand new sharing controls work with Facebook, Twitter, Email, iMessage, Instapaper, Pocket, Readability, App.Net, Pinboard, OmniFocus, Safari, Chrome, and Airdrop.</li>
  <li>Inline images show a preview of the story in the story title.</li>
  <li>Inline descriptions show a preview of the story’s content in the story title.</li>
  <li>Improved landscape support for the iPad app.</li>
  <li>Improved video support: videos are now fit better for each device.</li>
  <li>Numerous bugs fixed resulting in speed improvements and cleaned up code.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to tweet something along the lines of “Holy crap, the NewsBlur iOS app is nice! Only took four years” that would be alright. <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/ios">Download the free NewsBlur iOS app</a>, and if you find yourself enjoying it, please leave a positive five star review on the App Store.</p>

<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/newsblur">IFTTT</a> (if this then that) is a free web service that automates the movement of data from NewsBlur to dozens of other web services. It also handles movement of data from dozens of other web services back into NewsBlur. <a href="http://blog.ifttt.com/post/77287507657/introducing-the-newsblur-fiverr-and-boxcar-2-channels">Today IFTTT is launching a NewsBlur channel</a> where you can take advantage of their incredible glue that binds dozens of web service like NewsBlur in unique and customizable ways.</p>

<h2 id="customizable-ifttt-triggers">Customizable IFTTT triggers</h2>

<p>The best part about these IFTTT recipes is that the triggers can be customized to fit a specific saved story tag or blurblog or folder or feed. When you create a recipe using NewsBlur, you can choose which of your own feeds or tags you want to use.</p>

<p>You can also choose to only use unread focus (trained) stories. So you can filter out stories you don’t want to read and highlight the stories you do want to read using the Intelligence Trainer.</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.newsblur.com/2014/01/14/saved-story-tagging/">
      <![CDATA[<p>It’s one thing to follow a handful of sites and use NewsBlur’s training to only read the stories you want to read. But sometimes you want to come back to stories long after you’ve read them. You could save the story, but then you would have to either scroll down your saved story list to find the story, or use the <a href="http://blog.newsblur.com/2021/06/21/2013-07-30-simple-search-for-feeds-saved-stories-and-blurblogs.html">new search feature</a> to find it by title or author.</p>

<p>Today I would like to introduce a big new feature: saved story tagging. It works like this. When you save a story, it is automatically tagged with all of the folders that the site is part of.</p>

<p>After the story is auto-tagged by folder, you can then add your own tags, which are autocompleted by previously used tags. You can also click a button to auto-tag the story with its own tags, easily clicking on the tags you want to remove.</p>

<p>You can also search per-tag and soon you will be able to rename and delete tags. There are more plans to integrate tagging into both iOS and Android apps.</p>

<p>Saved story tags also have RSS feeds. This is a big deal, since this allows you to save stories and have them automatically ingested by <a href="http://www.ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> for use elsewhere. You already could share stories over your blurblog, but now you have a private RSS feed that gives you far greater control.</p>

<p>Stay tuned because there are even more big features coming soon. Telling your friends about NewsBlur, whether on Twitter and Facebook or when spying over their shoulder and noticing that they’re hitting the same dozen sites over and over again without letting the sites come to them with new stories, goes a long way towards getting new features built. More users means more premiums which means more features getting built. It’s a vicious cycle.</p>
