      <![CDATA[<p>The iOS app has enjoyed a feature that gives you a tiny preview of a story’s main image right in the story title. Today this feature launches on the web.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/inline_images.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What I’ve noticed is that while I don’t use the image to identify which stories I want to read, I do use them to act as a signature of a story.</p>

<p>There’s precedence for this on NewsBlur. Every site already does this using the color of its favicon. NewsBlur liberally applies a two-tone color palette based on each feed’s favicon. This serves as a per-feed signature, giving context to a story when it’s in the same view as every other feed’s stories.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/inline_images_left.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>These story preview thumbnails serve as the same signature. Stories are best remembered through their colors and photos, so thumbnails act as a visual signature that’s easy to recognize. It works on a subconscious but perceptable level.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/inline_images_pref.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Of course you can turn them right off.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>NewsBlur has an amazingly active third-party app community, thanks to the <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/api">well documented NewsBlur API</a>. Today I’d like to introduce you to two new apps built by developers on the NewsBlur API.</p>

<h2 id="hypersonic-for-windows-10--windows-phone">Hypersonic for Windows 10 &amp; Windows Phone</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/hypersonic/9nblggh5wnb6">Hypersonic</a> is clean, simple, beautiful, and designed to run across both mobile and desktop devices.</p>

<h2 id="add-my-feed-for-ios">Add My Feed for iOS</h2>

<p><a href="http://addmyfeed.cubesoft.fr">Add My Feed</a> is an extension allowing you to effortlessly add RSS feeds to your online reader of choice.</p>

<p>When you encounter a site you would like to subscribe to, simply tap the Add My Feed extension and you’re done !</p>

<p>Add My Feed works in Safari and in any app supporting the standard iOS share sheet.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Fth086Rlw5rB9ljQgFiJrkqupdOY3Xv501DOxZ2M4MN4k9goHi-dz-2n4vDiBn6ZUa7dvbEFqzb9Y5HH_7twqqJiY9Mrxw" alt="" /></p>

<p>Both of these apps and many more are on the <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/?next=goodies">Goodies &amp; Mobile Apps</a> dialog. If you’ve developed an app for NewsBlur and would like to add it to Goodies (and have it blogged about here), let me know!</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.newsblur.com/2016/01/15/improved-statistics/">
      <![CDATA[<p>That’s why I’m pleased to introduce more advanced statistics for every single feed. The Statistics dialog now shows a heat graph of the times of day that stories are published as well as the days of the weeks.</p>

<p>Take a look at the NewsBlur support feed, which you can subscribe to here: <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/site/644144/get-satisfaction-for-newsblur">http://www.newsblur.com/site/644144/get-satisfaction-for-newsblur</a></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/stats_getsatisfaction.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can see the post-Google Reader shutdown bump starting in March 2013 and will notice that most of NewsBlur’s support happens during the week. (I like to take weekends off and work on side projects and the occasional NewsBlur feature.) But due to NewsBlur’s international audience, support comes in at all hours of the day.</p>

<p>And of course one of NewsBlur’s most popular publishers is Kottke.org, home of fine hypertext products. You can subscribe to kottke.org here: <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/site/39/kottke.org.">http://www.newsblur.com/site/39/kottke.org.</a></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/stats_kottke.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Amazingly, over the lifetime of NewsBlur’s statistics feature (which launched originally in 2010), Jason Kottke has been both prolific and regular in his postings of what’s good on the web. He sticks to a 9-5 schedule and works only on weekdays.</p>

<p>Anything else you’d like to see on the statistics panel? Post an idea over on <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur">NewsBlur’s Get Satisfaction support site</a>.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Every NewsBlur client, from the three official clients (web, iOS, and Android) to all third-party clients, should now be showing better embeds for Twitter, Instagram, and Imgur. Just take a look at these screenshots.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/android_oembed_instagram.png" alt="" /> <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios_oembed_instagram.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And don’t forget that even YouTube gets special treatment on all three platforms. Here on the web, you can see that YouTube videos are automatically expanded to fill the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/oembed_web_youtube.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So there you go, enjoy the new embeds (also called oEmbeds, whatever that means). And if you have any suggestions for new embeds, just submit an idea to <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur.">http://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur.</a></p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Holy geez, this is a whopper of a release. Version 5.0 of the NewsBlur iOS app has lots and lots of new features, fixes for some long standing issues, and major performance improvements for reading stories.</p>

<p>The biggest new feature to hit the iOS app is the introduction of premium fonts from type foundry Hoefler &amp; Co. Whitney, Gotham Narrow, and Chronicle have been added to give NewsBlur a more pleasurable reading experience. Take a look for yourself.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios9_fonts.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Comment-less shares have also been added to the iOS app. You can now share a story and your friends can now reply without you having to write anything first, just like on the web and on the Android app.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios9_share.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here’s the full list of new features and improvements. Make a cup of tea first because this list is a doozy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The app has been iOS 9-ified.</li>
  <li>The iOS app now has the same great fonts from the web: Whitney, Gotham Narrow, and Chronicle. These each look fantastic.</li>
  <li>The Text view is now sticky based on the last view you used. It’s per feed but it also respects individual feeds when reading by folder. This is unlike the web, where the Text view matches the feed or folder. Now it’s sticky to the feed, which makes it much easier to read through a folder of stories.</li>
  <li>When switching between the Text view and Story view, the loading indicator is now at the bottom of the screen instead of directly on top of the story.</li>
  <li>Stories now remember your last scroll position. When you go back to a story, you are taken back to the same place you left off.</li>
  <li>New Safari-based browser for the original story. These views are faster and support content blockers on iOS 9 and use your browser’s cookies. However, they look like Safari and not NewsBlur, so the default in-app browser is the original browser. The new in-app Safari browser is a preference, along with Chrome, Opera, and the full Safari app.</li>
  <li>A new option to mark stories as read when they are scrolled past. Defaults to off.</li>
  <li>Sending stories to third-party services now uses full Text if available. Useful for storing full story text in Evernote or Pocket.</li>
  <li>Comment-less shares are now supported, allowing you to reply to shared stories that have no comment.</li>
  <li>The feed trainer now shows trained titles.</li>
  <li>1Password integration on login.</li>
  <li>iPad Pro is now supported.</li>
  <li>Date and times of stories now uses the system locale, so everybody who isn’t in the U.S. will see dates as they should be.</li>
  <li>3D Touch actions: Add site, all site stories, search stories.</li>
  <li>Voiceover support.</li>
  <li>iOS 8 is the minimum supported version for this release.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hot dog that’s a lot in one release. Version 5.0 is now ready for you. <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/ios">Download it for free on the App Store</a>.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>If you like living on the bleeding edge, you should join the NewsBlur iOS beta program. You’ll get access to the latest releases a few weeks before they go out publicly.</p>

<p>All you need to do is add your email address to this form: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XSerwoY-PEJ7JfglNr0zOKpsoMXqplSomdORSDsZ3_g/viewform?usp=send_form">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XSerwoY-PEJ7JfglNr0zOKpsoMXqplSomdORSDsZ3_g/viewform?usp=send_form</a></p>

<p>You might be wondering why this is a bit different than the older method used in the past. The old beta program used an enterprise distribution provision profile, which was available as a workaround to install apps on devices without having to go through the App Store. Unfortunately that program has ended and Apple now recommends using their new TestFlight beta program.</p>

<p>In order to use TestFlight, email addresses of interested beta testers need to be collected. But the benefit is that you can now easily move between beta and release versions. You will also automatically upgrade to the release version when it comes out. You can also give feedback in a more accurate way, with your device and OS version automatically added to anything you write as feedback.</p>

<p>So if you want to try out the latest betas, specifically for iOS 9 and a whole bundle of new features, then add your email to that list and watch your inbox. It can take up to a couple days for these emails to be imported, so be patient.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>What would an RSS news reader be without its own RSS feeds? It’s be a pretty lonely reader is what.</p>

<p>NewsBlur now supports RSS feeds for each of your folders. Just right-click on the folder, go to Folder Settings, and behold:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/folder_rss.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>These folders keep track of sites you add and remove from them. They also allow you to filter out stories you don’t want to read or even choose to only show the stories you have in focus.</p>

<p>All of your feed subscriptions in the folder, including subfolders, are merged into a single river of news in RSS format. Technically we use Atom 1.0 format for NewsBlur’s many RSS feeds, but I’m not choosing a side here.</p>

<p>The Folder RSS feeds join the Shared Stories RSS feeds and the Saved Story Tag RSS feeds that you can already use if you are a premium subscriber.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>YouTube, owned by Google, deprecated their v2 APIs on April 20th, 2015, which means that RSS news readers can no longer watch for new videos. What a bummer!</p>

<p>Except it’s not at all a big deal because here at NewsBlur we’re making sure that your videos keep coming in. Previously <a href="https://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur/topics/youtube-eliminating-support-for-rss-atom">enterprising users setup hacks and workarounds for the API</a>, which was a somewhat tedious solution as you had to update each feed and prone to breaking in the future.</p>

<p>But there’s good news today because NewsBlur now has a custom-built solution for YouTube videos. All of your existing YouTube RSS feeds are automatically ported over to the new YouTube video fetcher.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/youtube%20fetcher.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And that’s not all. The improved YouTube video fetcher now displays a big embedded video so you can watch the video right in NewsBlur.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/youtube%20detail.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To subscribe to new YouTube channels, just enter in the URL of the channel in the Add Site popover.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/youtube%20subscribe.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When Google takes away your tools, NewsBlur builds them better than before.</p>

    <published>2015-03-13T11:03:38-04:00</published>
    <updated>2015-03-13T11:03:38-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.newsblur.com/2015/03/13/bigger-story-previews-with-the-new-grid-view</id>
    <content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.newsblur.com/2015/03/13/bigger-story-previews-with-the-new-grid-view/">
      <![CDATA[<p>There are currently three ways to read stories on NewsBlur:</p>

<ul>
  <li>List view: every story is a single line and read inline</li>
  <li>Split view: two panes of stories, one for story titles and the other for story content</li>
  <li>Full view: every story is fully expanded and ready for reading</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these views has its own benefits and drawbacks, and each of these views can be further customized. The Split view, for instance, can place story titles on top, below, or to the left of the story content. The Full view can auto-truncate stories so that you only see a couple paragraphs at a time so long stories don’t overwhelm you.</p>

<p>Today I’m launching a new view: the Grid view.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/grid%201.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Grid view is half-way between the Full view and the List view. It provides big previews of the images from a story as well as several lines of content. It’s not as overwhelming as the Full view and it doesn’t force every story on a single line.</p>

<p>You can also customize the Grid view to only show as many stories per line as you like.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/grid%202.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Choose between 1, 2, 3, or 4 stories per line, or stick with automatically scaling the number of stories based on how wide your browser is.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/grid%203.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Grid view is perfect for sites and folders that contain a lot of images. And because you can now preview a larger part of the story, it makes sense to add a new preference that allows you to mark stories as read as you scroll without having to open up the story.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/grid%204.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>However, the Grid view is not perfect for all feeds. That’s why I’m introducing another big change today. The four views are now saved on a per-feed and per-folder basis. You can choose a default layout in Preferences, but each feed/folder overrides that preference.</p>

<p>This can become a bit complicated if you have a lot of overrides and want to instead just reset all of your layouts. So you can now reset both layouts and views for all feeds and folders right from the Preferences dialog.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/grid%205.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I hope you enjoy this new story layout. And as always, tell your friends about NewsBlur. World of mouth is killer and it’s how NewsBlur is able to be a success.</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.newsblur.com/2015/01/07/organize-your-subscriptions-with-the-new-organizer/">
      <![CDATA[<p>The beauty of NewsBlur is that you can start off with only a handful of subscriptions and naturally work your way up. This is actually the reason that free accounts cut off at 64 sites. When I started building NewsBlur in 2009 I only subscribed to 42 sites. Nowadays it’s closer to 200 sites.</p>

<p>Because NewsBlur makes it so easy to pare down individual stories with the intelligence trainer, you can follow more blogs without feeling overwhelmed. But that also leads to oversubscribing to sites that just don’t publish anymore. Or even subscribing to sites that publish too often.</p>

<p>Launching today is the Organizer. This organizer helps you identify sites that may be posting too much or too little and then gives you the power to move and delete them all at once. Sure, you can do this one-by-one, but that takes time, and only in the new Organizer is everything right in front of you.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/organizer.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can sort sites, both in and out of your folders, with the following orders:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By name</li>
  <li>By number of subscribers</li>
  <li>By frequency of updates (stories per day)</li>
  <li>By last story posted</li>
  <li>By the number of times you’ve opened the site</li>
</ul>

<p>You can multi-select sites and move/delete them in one single batch edit. You can even move a bunch of sites to a new folder that you can create right in the Organizer. This makes moving sites around so much easier. You can even click on the folder title to select every site underneath that folder.</p>

<p>Try out the new Organizer and let me know how it works. And go hog wild because you will be emailed a backup of your sites after you move or delete anything. You will only be emailed a backup a max of once per day, as to not overwhelm you when you’re making a bunch of edits.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>This is a huge release for the NewsBlur Android app. So much has happened in the last six months. We’ve had a big backend rewrite that makes the app feel like new. It’s faster, which is necessary to make the new offline reading feature really shine. Now you can read on your Android phone or tablet while on the train, underground, or just in airplane mode to save battery.</p>

<p>Better yet, not only can you read while offline, but you can better read at night with the new dark theme. Take a look.</p>

<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1920" data-orig-width="1200" data-orig-src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/android%20v4.png"><img data-orig-height="1920" data-orig-width="1200" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/android%20v4.png" /></figure>

<p>Here’s what’s new in version 4.0:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Offline reading and story syncing. Stories read while offline will sync as soon as you’re back online.</li>
  <li>Option to also store images from stories for offline reading. They do take space, though.</li>
  <li>A dark theme for reading at night.</li>
  <li>The Text mode can be set to automatically fetch, so you can get to the full text quicker.</li>
  <li>An option to mark stories newer than a story as read.</li>
  <li>Major backend improvements for faster story loading and transitions. This app should feel like new.</li>
</ul>

<p>The NewsBlur Android app is a <a href="https://www.newsblur.com/android">free download</a>. And as always, there’s more big ticket features coming soon for Android.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Modern browsers are taking your privacy and security seriously with new restrictions for sites that use https. You can choose to use NewsBlur over https, which will encrypt your communications with NewsBlur and prevent eavesdroppers—hackers, the government, other people on the same wireless network as you—from seeing what you see. While that’s not necessary for everybody, SSL/https is a priority for some and NewsBlur supports this beautifully.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=newsblur.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/SSL%20labs.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>However, what modern browsers like Chrome and Firefox do is not allow you to embed an insecure http-only site in an iframe from a secure https site. That means that the Story view in NewsBlur does not load a thing for many users who are reading NewsBlur over an https connection.</p>

<p>Today I’m launching a fix for this. It’s not perfect, but this will allow you to still get at some of the content while getting around the https-only issue. This feature will proxy http-only sites in the Story view, resulting in a hacked-together but workable view of the original story.</p>

<p>At best, the Story view will look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/Story%20Proxy%20view.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>At worst, the Story view will look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/Story%20Proxy%20view%20truncated.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>While it’s not ideal, it’s a whole lot better than a blank page. Let me know how this new proxied Story view works for you. And if you want it to work flawlessly and are willing to use an unencrypted connection, just use the http version of NewsBlur instead of the https version.</p>

<p>NewsBlur is more than just a website. It’s a daily link to the far away world. This t-shirt captures the essence of NewsBlur’s appeal. For those days when you’re planing adventures and reading about what’s happening where you’re not, NewsBlur is your guide.</p>

<p><a href="http://teespring.com/newsblur2014">Buy the 2014 NewsBlur t-shirt for only $16.30</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike Teespring’s preview, the graphics on this t-shirt are crisp. And this t-shirt is being sold at cost. Also know that this is a premium blend t-shirt. That means it’s a bit stretchy and will make you look pretty good in a t-shirt. It will look great today and for years to come. Well, at least one year to come. If you wear this t-shirt as often as I’m planning to, it may only get a couple good years and then will have to come out only for special events. But then 2015’s NewsBlur t-shirt will be there for you.</p>

<p>This year’s t-shirt is designed by <a href="http://meg-draws.com">Meg Robichaud</a>.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>So many things can go wrong and often do, but I spend a good third of my time working on infrastructure, monitoring, and analytics so that they don’t.</p>

<p>Here’s what happened: At approximately 4:30pm PT feed fetching ceased. The feed fetchers were still working, which is why my monitors didn’t fire and alert anybody. But I have a second large Mongo database server used exclusively for collecting data about feeds being fetched. There are approximately 75 servers dedicated to feed fetching. These analytics look at average fetch times on a per task server basis. I use these analytics to ensure that my task servers are humming along, as they each use a ton of network, cpu, and memory.</p>

<p>This Mongo analytics servers works in a curious way. If you right-click on a feed and go to Statistics you’ll see the feed fetch history for a feed, stretching back a hundred fetches if the feed has had any issues in fetching. I keep these statistics on an analytics server separate from the regular Mongo server. I do this so that if the mongo analytics server goes down, everything will operate normally.</p>

<p>But the mongo server didn’t go down. It merely gave this error:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>OperationError: Could not save document (Can't take a write lock while out of disk space)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Mongo continues serving read queries while not allowing write queries. I didn’t plan for that! And it gets worse. The way MongoDB stores data is that is just keeps growing, even as you delete data. NewsBlur only saves the last few fetches, but deleting old fetches doesn’t give you back any disk space. Every other database server I use has an autovacuum process that takes care of this maintenance work (PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, but not MongoDB). It’s unfortunate that this is yet another instance of MongoDB being the cause of downtime, even though the fault lies with me.</p>

<p>The server that is meant to only be used to ensure things are working correctly was itself the culprit for feeds no longer being fetched. This is the ironic part.</p>

<h6 id="newsblurs-developer-during-happier-times-wearing-the-2013-newsblur-t-shirt-in-big-sur">NewsBlur’s developer during happier times wearing the 2013 NewsBlur t-shirt in Big Sur</h6>

<p>Now comes the painful part. On Wednesday morning (yesterday) I packed my car and headed down to Big Sur to go backpack camping for the first time. I’ve car camped plenty of times, but I felt confident enough to pack my sleeping bag and tent into a big bag and head ten miles into the woods of coastal California.</p>

<p>I headed out, away from cellular service, at 4pm PT, half an hour before the analytics server ran out of disk space. And then returned nearly 24 hours later to a bevy of alarmed tweets, emails, direct messages, and a voicemail letting me know that things were haywire.</p>

<p>But the real problem is that I set a vacation reply on both my personal and work email accounts to say that I’d be out until September 3rd. Now, I hired a firm to watch the servers while I’m at Burning Man starting this Saturday. But I figured I could get away with leaving the servers for twenty four hours. And I neglected to tweet out that I’d be gone for a day, so theories cropped up that I was injured, dead, or worse, ignoring the service.</p>

<h6 id="brittany-newsblurs-developers-girlfriend-can-handle-any-situation-including-driving-a-hysterical-developer-three-hours-back-to-san-francisco-without-breaking-a-sweat">Brittany, NewsBlur’s developer’s girlfriend, can handle any situation, including driving a hysterical developer three hours back to San Francisco without breaking a sweat.</h6>

<p>If you’re wondering, I think about NewsBlur first thing in the morning and last thing at night when I check Twitter for mentions. It’s my life and I would never just give up on it. I just got cocky after a year and a half of nearly uninterrupted service. NewsBlur requires next to no maintenance, apart from handling support requests and building new features (and occasionally fixing old ones). So I figured what harm could 24 hours of away time be? Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>If you made it this far then you probably care about NewsBlur’s future. I want to not only assure you that I will be building better monitoring to ensure this never happens again, but to also offer anybody who feels that they are not getting their money’s worth a refund. Even if you are months away from payment, if you aren’t completely satisfied and think NewsBlur’s just about the best thing to happen to RSS since Brent Simmons released NetNewsWire back in 2004, then I want to give you your money back and let you keep your premium account until it expires.</p>

<p>I would like to also mention how much I appreciate the more light-hearted tweets that I read while on the frenetic three hour drive back to San Francisco from Big Sur. I do this for all of your happiness. If I did it for the money I’d probably find a way to juice the data so that I could at least afford to hire an employee. This is a labor of love and your payment goes directly into supporting it.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/feed_size_style.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Choose from extra small to extra large. These new font sizes not only give you extra customization, but they allow you to have bigger touch sizes for folks using touch screen monitors.</p>

<p>I use this to mute craigslist feeds that I no longer want to see in my unread stories list, but I want to keep just in case I need to perform a specific craigslist search without having to go through the whole process of recreating the RSS feed.</p>

<p>It’s also useful for subscribing to high volume sites and only reading them when you want to know what’s happening but without having to remember to re-subscribe. Such a simple feature but with a ton of utility.</p>

But instead of just allowing you to search by site, I created a new view that you can now use to see stories saved by site.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/saved_stories_view.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The neat thing about this new view is that it works for folders, too. If you click on a containing folder, you’ll see the saved stories from all of the sites inside that folder. And thanks to last month’s full text search, you can search all of these saved stories.</p>

<p>And you should expect that these features will eventually make their way to iOS and Android.</p>
