    <p>Until now, the Intelligence Trainer was strictly per-feed. Train a title, author, or tag on one site and it only affected that site. If you wanted to hide a topic everywhere, you had to repeat that training on each feed. With a few feeds, that’s fine. With a hundred, it’s tedious. With five hundred, it’s a non-starter.</p>

<p>If you’re a <a href="https://newsblur.com/?next=premium">Premium Archive</a> subscriber, you can now set any classifier to apply globally across all your feeds, or scoped to a specific folder. Train “sponsored” as a dislike once, and it hides sponsored stories everywhere. Train “kubernetes” as a like in your Tech folder, and it highlights kubernetes stories across every feed in that folder without touching the rest of your subscriptions.</p>

<h3 id="three-scope-levels">Three scope levels</h3>

<p>Every classifier pill in the Intelligence Trainer now shows three small scope icons on the left: a feed icon, a folder icon, and a globe icon.</p>

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Intelligence trainer showing a classifier pill with the three scope toggle icons (feed, folder, globe) -->
<p><img src="/assets/scope-toggle-icons.png" style="width: 90%;border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);margin: 24px auto;display: block;" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Per Site</strong> (feed icon) — The default. The classifier only applies to the feed you’re training. This is how classifiers have always worked.</li>
  <li><strong>Per Folder</strong> (folder icon) — The classifier applies to every feed in the same folder. If you later move the feed to a different folder, the classifier stays tied to the original folder.</li>
  <li><strong>Global</strong> (globe icon) — The classifier applies to every feed you subscribe to.</li>
</ul>

<p>Click any scope icon to switch. The active scope is highlighted, and a tooltip explains each level. Your choice is saved with the classifier.</p>

<h3 id="real-world-examples">Real-world examples</h3>

<p><strong>Hide a topic everywhere.</strong> Subscribe to lots of news feeds but never want to read about a recurring topic? Open the trainer on any feed, add the topic as a text or title classifier, thumbs-down it, and click the globe icon. Done — it’s hidden across all your feeds.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on a topic within a folder.</strong> Have a “Tech” folder with 40 feeds? Train “machine learning” as a like with the folder scope, and every feed in that folder will surface machine learning stories in your Focus view. Your cooking and sports feeds stay untouched.</p>

<p><strong>Dislike a prolific author.</strong> Some authors are syndicated across multiple sites. Instead of training the same author name on each feed, set it to global and it applies everywhere at once.</p>

<h3 id="manage-training-scope-filter">Manage Training scope filter</h3>

<p>The Manage Training tab now includes a scope filter alongside the existing sentiment, type, and search filters. You can quickly see all your global classifiers, all your folder-scoped classifiers, or narrow down to just per-site training.</p>

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Manage Training tab showing the scope filter segmented control (All, Per Site, Per Folder, Global) -->
<p><img src="/assets/manage-training-scope-filter.png" style="width: 90%;border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);margin: 24px auto;display: block;" /></p>

<p>Each classifier pill in the Manage Training list also shows a small colored scope badge, so you can tell at a glance whether a classifier is site-level, folder-level, or global.</p>

<h3 id="how-scoping-works-under-the-hood">How scoping works under the hood</h3>

<p>When NewsBlur scores a story, it checks all classifiers that apply to that story’s feed — including any folder-scoped classifiers for the feed’s folder and any global classifiers. The same “green always wins” rule applies: if a story matches both a liked global classifier and a disliked per-site classifier, the story is marked as Focus.</p>

<p>Scope controls work with all classifier types: titles, authors, tags, text, and URLs. They also work with regex classifiers.</p>
