    <p>Over the years I’ve trained NewsBlur on hundreds of authors, tags, and titles across dozens of feeds. But when I wanted to review what I’d trained, I had to open each feed’s trainer individually and click through them one by one. That’s fine when you’re training a new feed, but it’s tedious when you want to see the big picture of all your training.</p>

<p>Today I’m launching the Manage Training dialog, a consolidated view of every classifier you’ve ever trained, organized by folder. You can see everything at a glance, edit inline, and save changes across multiple feeds in a single click.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/manage-training-overview.png" style="width: 90%;border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);margin: 24px auto;display: block;" /></p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>

<p>Open the Intelligence Trainer from the sidebar menu (or press the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t</code> key). You’ll now see two tabs at the top: “Site by Site” and “Manage Training”.</p>

<p>The Site by Site tab is the existing trainer you know—it walks you through each feed showing authors, tags, and titles you can train. That’s still the best way to train new feeds with lots of suggestions.</p>

<p>The Manage Training tab shows only what you’ve already trained. Every thumbs up and thumbs down you’ve ever given, organized by folder just like your feed list. Each feed shows its trained classifiers as pills you can click to toggle.</p>

<!-- SCREENSHOT: Close-up of a folder section showing feed names with their trained classifiers as pills (green for like, red for dislike) -->
<p><img src="/assets/manage-training-folder.png" style="width: 80%;border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);margin: 24px auto;display: block;" /></p>

<h3 id="edit-inline-and-save-in-bulk">Edit inline and save in bulk</h3>

<p>Click any classifier pill to toggle it between like, dislike, and neutral. The Save button shows exactly how many changes you’ve made, so you always know what’s pending. Made a mistake? Just click again to undo—the count updates automatically.</p>

<!-- SCREENSHOT: The bottom of the Manage Training tab showing "Save 3 changes" button -->
<p><img src="/assets/manage-training-save.png" style="width: 60%;border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);margin: 24px auto;display: block;" /></p>

<p>When you click Save, all your changes across all feeds are saved in a single request. No more clicking through feeds one at a time to clean up old training.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>

<p>The Intelligence Trainer is one of NewsBlur’s most powerful features, but it’s only useful if you can manage what you’ve trained. Now you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Audit your training</strong>: See at a glance which feeds you’ve trained heavily and which need attention</li>
  <li><strong>Clean up old training</strong>: Remove classifiers that no longer make sense after a feed changed focus</li>
  <li><strong>Fix mistakes</strong>: Quickly find and correct classifiers you set incorrectly</li>
</ul>

<p>The Manage Training tab is available now on the web. If you have feedback or ideas for improvements, please share them on the <a href="https://forum.newsblur.com">NewsBlur forum</a>.</p>
