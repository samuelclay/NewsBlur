          <p>Not to say that NewsBlur was <em>ugly</em> before today, but it certainly didn’t have the loving embrace of a talented designer. So without waiting another moment (or month) I proudly present the NewsBlur redesign.</p>

<p><img src="http://dev.newsblur.com/media/img/welcome/header-web.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>It’s a full scale redesign, too. And not just one of those redesigns where the icons get glossier and fonts, bolder. Every moving piece of machinery got more than a coat of paint. A number of new crucial reading features have been added. Some features were merged, some were repaired, and some were scrapped.</p>

<p>Dashboard before &amp; after:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/before_dashboard.png" alt="image" /> <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/after_dashboard.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Reading before &amp; after:</p>

<p>In no particular order, here’s what’s new:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unified interactions/activities popover. Gets out of your way and gives the dashboard more room to breath.</li>
  <li>Rewritten feed loader, offering incredible performance, even at the 20x scale of today vs 2 months ago before the Google Reader announcement.</li>
  <li>Custom vector graphics, retina-fying the entire site.</li>
  <li>Increased transparency of sites by showing more detail in feed fetching/statistics.</li>
  <li>A new List view to complement the Split view for stories.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s just for the website. The iOS app, Android app, and blurblogs all got the update goodness that has graced the web app.</p>

<p><img src="http://dev.newsblur.com/media/img/welcome/header-ios.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>As for what’s happening these days, post-Reader:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Took some extra time to scale out my backend, now completed.</li>
  <li>Running on 48 servers, serving 20x traffic</li>
  <li>Because I had the foresight to charge users for premium service, I’m now confident that NewsBlur will be standing tall a few years from now.</li>
  <li>Working on the next few big ticket features: saved story search and tagging, batch editing organizer, keyboard shortcut manager, and more.</li>
</ul>

  <p>Biggest unanticipated consequence of the Reader shutdown – I no longer have to wear a jacket in SF because my core temperature has risen.</p>

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript"></script>

<p>And if you’re new to NewsBlur, here’s the six core benefits to using the one with the Sun:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Training</strong> - hide the stories you don’t like and highlight the stories you do. Make mincemeat out of heavy feeds and make sure to never miss stories from the feeds you love.</li>
  <li><strong>Original site</strong> - read a publisher’s stories the way they wanted you to read it - on the original website. NewsBlur embeds the publisher’s site in an iframe, and marks what you read as read as you scroll.</li>
  <li><strong>Text view</strong> - conveniently extracts the story text from articles, necessary for reading truncated rss feeds.</li>
  <li><strong>Blurblogs / sharing</strong> - a social community where you can share and discuss stories with friends.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed</strong> - A dedication to fast load times, graphed on your dashboard.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile</strong> - native, first-class iOS and Android apps, with all of the functionality of the website.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that the redesign has launched, I plan to blog about how to best use the intelligence trainer efficiently, all new [future] features, and how I was able to successfully scale out the four databases (count ‘em: postgresql, mongodb, redis, elasticsearch) to handle more than 10,000 users and 4 million site updates a day. It’s no Tumblr, but it’s still way more traffic than you can fit on a single machine.</p>

<p>Thanks for using NewsBlur and turning my passion project (four years running) into a full-time dream.</p>

          <p>At 4:16pm last Wednesday I got a short and to-the-point email from Nilay Patel at The Verge with only a link that started with the host “googlereader.blogspot.com”. The sudden spike in NewsBlur’s visitors immediately confirmed — Google was shutting down Reader.</p>

<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="800" data-orig-width="600" data-orig-src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/Late%20night%20at%20the%20office.jpeg"><img width="500" style="margin: 0 auto;" data-orig-height="800" data-orig-width="600" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/Late%20night%20at%20the%20office.jpeg" /></figure>

<h5 id="late-night-at-the-office">Late night at the office</h5>

<p>I had been preparing for a black swan event like this for the last four years since I began NewsBlur. With the deprecation of their social features a year ago I knew it was only a matter of time before Google stopped supporting Reader entirely. I did not expect it to come this soon.</p>

<p>As the <a href="http://storify.com/mattrose/reader-o-calypse-from-the-pov-of-a-competitor">Storify history of the Reader-o-calypse</a>, NewsBlur suffered a number of hurdles with the onslaught of new subscribers.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-of-my-challenges-and-solutions">A few of my challenges and solutions</h2>

<p>I was able to handle the 1,500 users who were using the service everyday, but when 50,000 users hit an uncachable and resource intensive backend, unless you’ve done your homework and load tested the living crap out of your entire stack, there’s going to be trouble brewing. Here’s just a few of the immediate challenges I faced over the past four days:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My hosting provider, Reliable Hosting Services, was neither reliable, able to host my increasing demands, or a service I could count on. I switched to Digital Ocean and immediately got to <a href="https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/blob/master/fabfile.py#L934-L970">writing new Fabric scripts</a> so I could deploy a new app/task server by issuing a single command and having it serve requests automatically within 10 minutes of bootstrapping.</li>
  <li>It didn’t take long to max out my Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) account’s quota of 10,000 emails a day. So a few hours into the melee I switched to Mailgun, which unfortunately resulted in emailing myself 250,000 error reports. If you tried to email me and couldn’t get through, it’s because 50,000 emails about lost database connections made their way ahead of you in line.</li>
  <li>Eventually, I was just plain blacklisted on SES for sending too many emails.</li>
  <li>Fortunately, when the PayPal fraud department called because of an unprecedented spike in payments, I was prepared.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paypal’s fraud department just called, asked me what’s going on. Asked the rep from Omaha if she’s heard of Reader, and then a big Ohhh.</p>

  <p>— NewsBlur (@NewsBlur) <a href="https://twitter.com/NewsBlur/status/313354032083259394">March 17, 2013</a></p>
</blockquote>

<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<ul>
  <li>HAProxy would serve errors (site is down, maintenance, timeouts, etc) with a 200 OK status code instead of the proper 500 Exception status code because of a ridiculous undocumented requirement to <a href="https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/blob/master/templates/502.http#L1-L4">include HTTP Headers at the top of the error template</a>. When your webapp uses status codes to determine errors, you get extremely strange behavior when it loads utter crap into your DOM.</li>
  <li>The inevitable file descriptor limits on Linux means that for every database connection you make, you use up one of the 1,024 file descriptors that are allocated to your process by default. Changing these limits is not only non-trivial, but they don’t tend to stick. This is responsible for bringing down Mongo, PostgreSQL, and the real-time Node servers, all at different times of the night.</li>
  <li>The support queue is enormous and I’ve had to spend big chunks of my 16 hour days reassuring paying customers that eventually Stripe will forgive me and my unresponsive servers and will send the payment notification that is responsible for automatically upgrading their accounts to premium.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a one-man-shop it has been humbling to receive the benefit of the doubt from many who have withheld their judgment despite the admittedly slow loadtimes and downtime NewsBlur experienced. Having the support of the amazing NewsBlur community is more than a guy could ask for. The tweets of encouragement, voting NewsBlur up on <a href="http://replacereader.com">replacereader.com</a> (If you haven’t yet, please tweet a vote for <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=webclient&amp;text=I%20think%20%23NewsBlur%20should%20%23replacereader.%20http://replacereader.com">“#newsblur to #replacereader”</a>), and the many positive comments and blog posts from people who have tried NewsBlur is great.</p>

<p>It has also been a dream come true to receive accolades from the many who are trying NewsBlur for the first time and loving it. Since the announcement, NewsBlur has welcomed 5,000 new premium subscribers and 60,000 new users (from 50,000 users originally).</p>

<h1 id="the-next-three-months">The next three months</h1>

<p>Over the next three months I’ll be working on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scaling, scaling, scaling</li>
  <li>Launching the redesign (<a href="http://dev.newsblur.com">which you can preview</a>)</li>
  <li>Listening to all of you</li>
</ul>

<p>For those of you who are still trying to decide where to go now that you’re a Reader refugee let me tell you a few of the unique things NewsBlur has to offer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Radical transparency. <a href="https://github.com/samuelclay">NewsBlur is totally open source</a> and will remain that way.</li>
  <li>It still feels like RSS, just with a few more bells and whistles. NewsBlur provides actual list of posts, as opposed to the more curated magazine format of some of the other popular replacements. This clean interface makes it easy to see the stories you want. One innovation however is the four different view options you have. NewsBlur can show you the original site, feed, text or story view.</li>
  <li>It has training. NewsBlur hides stories you don’t want to read based on tags, keywords, authors, etc. It also highlights stories you want to read, based on the same criteria. This allows you to find the stories you care about, not just the stories that the hive cares about. And best of all, NewsBlur will show you why stories are either highlighted or hidden by showing the criteria in green or red.</li>
  <li>NewsBlur has rebuilt the social community that Google had stripped out of Reader. Users can share stories through their Blurblog and discover new content by following friends’ Blurblogs. <a href="http://popular.newsblur.com">The People Have Spoken</a> is the blurblog of popular stories.</li>
  <li>Because NewsBlur is entirely open-source, if you don’t want to pay you can host your own server. <a href="http://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur">Instructions are on GitHub</a>, where you can also find the source code for the <a href="https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/tree/master/media/ios">NewsBlur iPhone + iPad app</a> and <a href="https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/tree/master/media/android/NewsBlur">Android app</a>.</li>
  <li>Most importantly, NewsBlur is not entirely a free app. The immediate benefits of revenue have been very clear over the past few days. Not only are NewsBlur’s interests aligned with its users, but as more users join NewsBlur, it makes more revenue that can be used to directly support the new users. Not convinced that paid is better than free? Read Pinboard’s Maciej Ceglowski’s essay <a href="http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/">Don’t Be a Free User</a>.</li>
</ol>

          <p>Here at NewsBlur HQ, we love greeting each new day by seeing what everyone posts on their blurblogs, but we understand that not everyone might want to have their reading preferences broadcast to the public (or have the public broadcast its opinions on said preferences). So we’re introducing a special new service for premium account holders that allows you to protect your posts from prying eyes.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/Screen%20Shot%202012-12-17%20at%20Dec%2017%2012.17.51%20PM.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Just click the little sprocket in the bottom left of your dashboard and select “Profile &amp; Blurblog,” where you’ll be given one of three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Public (default): The good old-fashioned oversharing you’ve come to know and love.</li>
  <li>Protected: Everyone can see your stories, but only approved NewsBlur followers can reply or comment to your shares. Continue to drop knowledge for a grateful public, minus the peanut gallery.</li>
  <li>Private: Only your approved followers can see your shares and comment. The outside world will never know about your love of bunny photos and animated GIFs. If you choose one of the latter two options, you’ll receive an e-mail every time someone requests to follow you, allowing you to carefully curate your inner circle. Want to remove any of your existing followers? Just visit their profile to boot them from blurblog access.</li>
</ul>

<p>Go forth and privatize! It’ll be our little secret, at least until we discover that one of you is having an affair with your biographer.</p>

Maybe you don’t want everyone to know just how crazy you’ve gotten about jai-alai or aerotrekking or My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. Or maybe you found a cool article on Facebook or Twitter or through an e-mail from a friend, and don’t want to go through the hassle of adding the site’s whole feed to your NewsBlur dashboard just to post one piece.</p>

Whether it’s a great article from a site that you don’t like enough to follow regularly, or a first glimpse at an intriguing new site, the bookmarklet makes it easy to post anything you find around the Web to your blurblog.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/Screen%20Shot%202012-12-17%20at%20Dec%2017%2011.58.26%20AM.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Setting up the bookmarklet tool is easy: Click on the little sprocket in the bottom left of your dashboard, and choose “Goodies &amp; Extras” from the menu. You’ll see “Add Site &amp; Share Story Bookmarklet,” and next to that, a button that says “Share on NewsBlur.” Drag the button to the Bookmarks Bar in your browser, and you’re in business.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsblur.com/?next=goodies"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/Screen%20Shot%202012-12-17%20at%20Dec%2017%2011.56.14%20AM.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>The next time you see an article that strikes your fancy, just click the bookmarklet and the NewsBlur window will open. (If you click it by accident or decide you don’t want to share, just click anywhere outside of the box, and you’ll be back where you started.) The bookmarklet automatically selects all text on a page by default, but if you only want to blog a certain chunk of a story, just highlight it beforehand, and it’ll appear solo in the box.</p>

<p>You can also type within the box to edit the headline and text or delete any extraneous junk that may have wandered in. Add a comment of your own, click “Share This Story,” and you’re on your way. It’s frankly almost too easy, so be sure you’re in the right browser tab when you launch it– <a href="http://alliepape.newsblur.com">Allie</a> once accidentally posted the contents of her Gmail inbox to her blurblog when she wasn’t paying attention. If any of you happened to be on there in those two minutes, she hopes you enjoyed the sneak peek into her darkest secrets, like all the books she has on hold at the library.</p>

<p>Using the bookmarklet is awesome and makes NewsBlur’s content (and by extension, <a href="http://popular.newsblur.com">the Popular blog</a>) far more interesting and diverse, so get out there and drag back the best of the Web to share with your fellow users. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_E2EHVxNAE">As Richard Marx would put it</a>: Wherever you go, whatever you do (on the Internet, at least), the NewsBlur bookmarklet will be right here waiting for you.</p>

          <p>Now that NewsBlur has joined the wonderful world of Android, we’re turning our attention back to the iOS app, with a full-scale feature parity push for the new iPhone 5 and iOS 6. It’s perfect for catching up on your reading when you realize that Apple Maps has sent you to the wrong address. Again.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/iOS%20v1.6%20-%20Folders.png" alt="image" /> <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/iOS%20v1.6%20-%20Menus.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>We’ve tried to incorporate as many of your suggestions as possible, and here are some of the new features you’ll find:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Collapsible folders: Check out folders one at a time (and save your scrolling fingers some work)</li>
  <li>Saved stories: Access all your saved stories from the Web or other devices, and save other stories for later</li>
  <li>Mark stories as unread: For that fresh new-story feeling</li>
  <li>Send stories to Instapaper for reading later, or e-mail them to your friends/enemies</li>
  <li>Share stories on Twitter and Facebook, and crush social-media naysayers who think you’re just telling people what you ate for breakfast</li>
  <li>New app-wide menus: An interface almost as stylish as your new device, and far less vulnerable to breakage and theft</li>
  <li>Bug fixes, improvements, speed-ups, fine-tuning, and other things that aren’t particularly noticeable (but done because we love you)</li>
</ul>

<p>Check out the update, and be sure to let us know if anything isn’t working the way it should. And Android folks, don’t feel left out; an update with bug fixes is in the pipeline, so stay tuned (and thanks for the feedback!).</p>

          <p>For a long time, we’ve maintained <a href="http://popular.newsblur.com">The People Have Spoken</a>, the blog of what’s popular on NewsBlur, with a simple algorithm that measured how often something was shared. While that’s a great way to see the stuff our users really like (<a href="http://xkcd.com/">Randall Munroe</a> would probably win the NewsBlur equivalent of the Oscar), it makes it harder for everyone to find new stuff that they might not have seen or heard of before. So we’ve decided to throw a human into the mix. I’ll let Allie introduce herself in her own words:</p>

<p><a href="http://alliepape.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/BigShot.jpg" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Hi, I’m <a href="http://alliepape.com">Allie Pape</a>. I’m a journalist here in San Francisco, and I met Sam when he e-mailed me about <a href="http://www.thebolditalic.com/alliepape/stories/2206-friend-me">an article I wrote about making friends in the city</a>. I love to read and spend most of my day paging through articles on the Internet, so I was excited to use NewsBlur as a way to manage and share my discoveries.</p>

<p>Sam’s given me the keys to the Popular account, so I’m going to be following as many active NewsBlur users as possible, and re-posting 3-4 articles per day that I think are particularly notable. I’ll also sprinkle in some things that I find outside of NewsBlur, if I think they’re interesting enough.</p>

<p>This is an experiment, and since I’m just one person, you will probably find some biases in the kind of stuff I like to post. I prefer long pieces to short, and I definitely have a few areas that are of major interest to me (food, pop culture, feminism and women’s issues, and socioeconomic trends) and a few that aren’t (sports, tech). I’ll try to read outside of my comfort zone when I can, but I can’t promise that I can be all things to all people. The hope is, though, that I can get more people reading NewsBlur, which means Sam can afford to hire other people with different interests to do additional curation for the community. And even if you think my taste is terrible, it’s probably more interesting than seeing the same three or four blogs’ posts over and over again.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about me or have comments or feedback, you can write to me at <a href="mailto:allie@newsblur.com">allie@newsblur.com</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you’ll subscribe to the Popular blurblog, and that I’m able to introduce you to something new and cool you haven’t seen before.</p>

          <p>There’s no wrong way to hold an iPad loaded with <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/ipad">the brand new NewsBlur iPad app</a>, provided it’s facing you and turned on.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsblur.com/ipad"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/iPad.png" alt="image" title="The NewsBlur iPad app in revealing positions" /></a></p>

<p>This brand new iPad app is not just an accessory to the web. It’s a full blown reading experience. Here are some of the many features now available in the palm of your hands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All your sites, folders, and friend’s blurblogs</li>
  <li>Super-fast everything, from near-instant downloading of stories to the mouthfeel of the app itself</li>
  <li>Commenting on stories and sharing them on your blurblog</li>
  <li>New users can easily get started by importing directly from Google Reader, so you can tell friends about the app without having them to go the website first</li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest new feature is all about sharing stories with people. Blurblogs, those shared story feeds, are now part of your feed list. And you can expand your network by following more people directly from the app. Following more people means being exposed to stories from sites you may not have even heard of. And because the NewsBlur iPad app is so fast, you can traverse between stories quickly, settling on the ones that look interesting. And better yet, see contribute to a discussion between friends, all on the app.</p>

<p>But wait, there’s more! In fact, there’s a whole lot more, because this is a universal iOS app, which means there’s an iPhone app to boot. Everything you can do on the iPad app is available on the iPhone app.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsblur.com/ipad"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/iPhone.png" alt="image" title="NewsBlur iPhone app to boot" /></a></p>

<p>The iPad app and latest version of the iPhone app were built by my good friend Roy. Now that the Y Combinator summer has ended, we wish him well as he’s moving on to pursue his non-news dreams. So long buddy, and thanks for all the hard work this summer. Roy <a href="http://roycyang.tumblr.com/post/30118352382/what-ive-learned-during-my-summer-in-yc">wrote about his impression</a> of Y Combinator and the past summer.</p>

<p>Go <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/ipad">download the NewsBlur iOS app</a> and forget about sitting at your desk.</p>

        <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>What a difference a few months make. NewsBlur was a side-project of mine for two years. In March of this year, <a href="[http://blog.newsblur.com/2021/06/21/2012-03-01-going-full-time.html](http://blog.newsblur.com/2021/06/21/2012-03-01-going-full-time.html)">I committed myself full-time</a> and went from developing NewsBlur almost entirely on the NYC subway to writing code every waking minute of the day. And now there are three big announcements to make. # 1. NewsBlur is now a *social* news reader The big news of the day is that you can now share stories on NewsBlur. When you share a story, your comments and the original story are posted to your blurblog. Your blurblog is a simple and customizable website. People can comment and reply directly on your blurblog, and you can follow your friends to read the news stories and blog posts that they care about.<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="869" data-orig-width="600" data-orig-src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3e1r202n3I232M473J2b/blurblog%20screenshot.png"><img style="margin: 0 auto;width: 600px; height: 869px; border: 1px solid #A0A0A0" data-orig-height="869" data-orig-width="600" src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3e1r202n3I232M473J2b/blurblog%20screenshot.png" /></figure>Since you’re good at picking your friends, and your friends are good at picking their friends, you will see friends of friends show up, expanding your network with shared stories that you will enjoy. It’s a new way of sharing the news. And because NewsBlur is already an easy to use news reader, it’s simple to find and share stories that your friends will care about. Every NewsBlur user has their own blurblog. All you have to do is signup for an account on <a href="[http://www.newsblur.com](http://www.newsblur.com)">www.newsblur.com</a> and share interesting stories. # 2. Y Combinator For those of you who work with computer science, you may know that a Y-combinator generalizes recursion, abstracting its implementation, and thereby separating it from the actual work of the function in question.[^1] <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="81" data-orig-width="500"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/97d36e865086575a3b131e7ec928534e/c3a0661d97716fb7-14/s540x810/172c7f8b8367a623b61a3f26e3d95ff5214b5e2c.png" style="margin: 12px auto;width: 200px;border: none" data-orig-height="81" data-orig-width="500" /></figure></a>I’m pleased as punch to announce an investment in NewsBlur by Y Combinator, the investment firm. Over the past two months, we’ve been humbled by the roster of experienced partners giving us candid advice. It’s their tough love that is the catalyst for the next few months of transitioning NewsBlur from side project to world-class news reader. Expect NewsBlur to become simpler and more refined. # 3. Introducing Roy Yang When Y Combinator accepted me as a solo founder, their first piece of advice was to find a co-founder. Looking at every successful startup, a common pattern emerges. Every great startup has multiple people carrying the load when the company takes off. There is one person on this planet that I would trust as a co-founder. His name is Roy Yang and we have been friends since we met in New York four years ago. We worked together for nearly two years at Daylife, another news startup. I attended his wedding last year in Mexico, and he was the only person I called when I knew I needed somebody talented, focused, and able to complement me on a project that demands enormous time and effort.<a href="http://roy.newsblur.com"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="334" data-orig-width="500"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/88d3942183371de8e848da2416f28e29/c3a0661d97716fb7-c9/s540x810/028ee543cc6fd18a9daff3b46fbaaf1408994f25.jpg" style="margin: 12px auto;border: none" data-orig-height="334" data-orig-width="500" /></figure></a>Roy is now responsible for both iOS apps and is instrumental in challenging me when I think I’m right and am clearly not. He’s got the patience of a monk and the determination of a true New Yorker. <a href="[http://roy.newsblur.com](http://roy.newsblur.com)">Follow Roy’s blurblog</a> to keep up with him. # A glimpse into the future of NewsBlur This summer marks the beginning of NewsBlur as a full-time startup. Look forward to new mobile apps, new designs, and new features. Here’s a quick idea of what we’re working on for the next few weeks:</p>
