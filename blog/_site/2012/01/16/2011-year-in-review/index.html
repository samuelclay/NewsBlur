    <p>Twelve months can be a quick flyby if you don’t stop to write everything down. Luckily, a habit I’ve kept since July 2009, when I started recording monthly goals for my project, is still going strong.</p>

<p>This gives me the opportunity to review everything that we’ve accomplished in the past year. There were numerous new features, about half of which were created as a result of feedback from the community. You asked for it, I found the time.</p>

<p>It’s been a pretty good cycle that looks like it’s going to keep going for years.</p>

<h2 id="premium-accounts-are-keeping-newsblur-alive">Premium accounts are keeping NewsBlur alive</h2>

<p>At only a $1/month, nearly 800 people have subscribed to NewsBlur. Not much of it goes back to me, since the servers, between the eight of them, cost $650 every month. But that gap is increasing and my prediction is that these servers should be good for more than a doubling of traffic.</p>

<h2 id="social-is-coming">Social is coming</h2>

<p>In October Google Reader dropped its social features and there was an enormous influx of new users. Unfortunately, NewsBlur doesn’t have any social features that could be considered a replacement for the community lost in the Reader sunsetting.</p>

<p>But that’s changing soon. There’s only a couple more weeks of development needed before the Social branch is ready for beta testers. And I’ll be taking feedback on the changes, iterating until sharebro communities are able to form. It’ll be a great time, watching a favorite service evolve into a social community.</p>

<p>If you’re a developer, you might enjoy watching the development of <a href="http://github.com/samuelclay">NewsBlur on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2011-calendar">2011 Calendar</h2>

<p>The biggest features built this year were the River of News, the iPhone app, and the API. There were tons of other big features, but these three top the list for their importance.</p>

<h3 id="january-2011">January 2011</h3>

<ul>
  <li>River of News - read all stories in a folder</li>
  <li>“Show N hidden stories” button</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.newsblur.com/?next=goodies">Bookmarklet</a> - browser bookmark that allows you to subscribe to a site from the site itself</li>
  <li>Favicon fetching and color decomposing - the color gradient that matches the site’s favicon.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="february-2011">February 2011</h3>

<ul>
  <li>New dashboard</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="march-2011">March 2011</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Send story by email - the original social network</li>
  <li>Community feedback on the dashboard</li>
  <li>The tutorial - built because blogger Louis Gray didn’t easily grasp how to get started with NewsBlur, and he’s an early adopter, so good luck to any regular users without the help of a tutorial</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="june-2011">June 2011</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Prototype mobile site - using jQuery UI, was a disaster in terms of performance</li>
  <li>Took a 2 week long vacation to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/conesus/sets/72157626885528004/">Yucatan</a></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="november-2011">November 2011</h3>

<p>You can follow updates in real-time on Twitter by following both <a href="http://twitter.com/samuelclay">@samuelclay</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/newsblur">@newsblur</a>. Lots more to come.</p>

<p>Keep the feedback, ideas, praise, and bugs coming. I couldn’t do this without the external motivation coming from dozens of your voices talking about NewsBlur.</p>
