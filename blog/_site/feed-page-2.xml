      <![CDATA[<p>The Text view is one of the most popular NewsBlur features. It’s available on all three platforms and gives you the full text of the original story, even in truncated RSS feeds. Up until today, NewsBlur’s implementation of the Text view used Readability’s open source text extractor.</p>

<p>Starting today, all stories will be run through <a href="https://mercury.postlight.com/web-parser/">Postlight Labs’ Mercury Parser</a>. That means that not only will the full text be more likely to correctly pull the entire article, but it will also do a much better job with extracting full size images in stories.</p>

<p>Take a look:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/text_view_images.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A welcome improvement. This new text extractor and parser also does a better job of handling Unicode and Chinese characters. And when it doesn’t extract text as well as the old text extractor, NewsBlur will automatically fallback on the old method.</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.newsblur.com/2017/06/14/launching-real-time-filterable-push-notifications/">
      <![CDATA[<p>For some sites, you want to know when they publish as soon as they publish. Maybe you want to immediately be notified of everything a site publishes, like a monthly meetup that posts an event only once a month. Or perhaps you want to be immediately notified of everything the NYTimes publishes about the companies in your stock portfolio. Or you just really enjoy reading your daily comics and want them emailed to you so you never miss a beat.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.newsblur.com/media/blog/notifications-announcement.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Today I’m proud to launch push notifications simultaneously across all three native platforms on NewsBlur (that’s web, iOS, and Android). That means that you can setup notifications for all Unread stories or only Focus stories that you’ve trained to be pushed to you over email, iOS, Android, or through browser notifications on the web.</p>

<p>You can setup all four types of notifications on both web and mobile. And you can employ your intelligence training to only surface the stories that have use certain tags, have specific keywords in the titles, or are written by specific authors. Additionally, it’s easy to hide stories using that same training so that you don’t receive notifications that you want to ignore.</p>

<h2 id="push-notifications-on-ios">Push notifications on iOS</h2>

<p>To start with notifications on iOS, you can use the new swipe-to-the right gesture on the feed list (replacing the trainer on the swipe gesture). It’s very easy to turn notifications on and off or to even step up the filtering on a site so that you only get Focus stories instead.</p>

<p>This way you can overprovision notifications for yourself and easily dial them back to where you get just the right number of notifications.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/notifications-ios.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Today version 7.0 of the NewsBlur iOS app is being released and here’s a list of what’s new and fixed on iOS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Push notifications: real-time push notifications on a per-feed basis.</li>
  <li>Swipe-to-the-right on a feed to change its notifications.</li>
  <li>A new optional app badge for unread counts. Enable under Preferences.</li>
  <li>Stories now automatically are marked as read on scroll. Disable under Preferences.</li>
  <li>Better image support on iPad and fixes for drag-and-dropping the story titles bar (at bottom of the story detail).</li>
  <li>A note on that: you can move story titles to the bottom on iPad. Just drag the bottom bar up.</li>
  <li>Fixed issue with sharing stories not working or disappearing on iPad.</li>
  <li>Fixed theme issues in the activity share sheet.</li>
  <li>Fixed a crash from opening stories with no permalink.</li>
  <li>Fixed size of intelligence control on bottom of feed list on iPhone SE.</li>
  <li>Fixed issues when story titles are set to the bottom layout on iPad.</li>
  <li>Fixed issues with the interactions dialog.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="notifications-on-android">Notifications on Android</h1>

<p>Android also gets a new version today. Version 6.0 gets notifications and new custom reading fonts as well as the mark read on scroll behavior that iOS and web have enjoyed.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/notifications-android.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here’s a list of what’s new and fixed on Android:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mark as read on scroll is a new preference to automatically mark stories as read as you scroll past them.</li>
  <li>New fonts for reading: Whitney, Chronicle, Gotham Narrow make their way to Android from the web.</li>
  <li>Also supporting native Android fonts Noto Sans, Noto Serif, Open Sans Condensed, and Anonymous Pro.</li>
  <li>Switching between Text and Story view is now sticky per-feed (similar to iOS and web).</li>
  <li>Fixed issues where feed list would not update.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="notifications-on-web">Notifications on Web</h1>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/notifications-options.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Browser notifications are handy for those sites that you only want to read on your desktop. For example, you could setup web notifications for an RSS feed for a status feed, letting you know when migrations and downtime will have some effect on you.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/notifications-sites.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Setting up and tuning notifications is also just as easy to do on the web. You’ll find it under Manage &gt; Notifications as well as in the Read Filter Popover (top right of the app) when reading an individual feed.</p>

<h1 id="notifications-over-email">Notifications over Email</h1>

<p>Finally, for those use cases not covered under web or mobile, you can now have websites automatically email you when they publish new stories.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/notifications-email.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is for those stories that you don’t want to miss and want to ensure that you read. For instance, I use email notifications for <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/site/5586842/quotes-worrydream.com">worrydream’s quote blog that serves me a single paragraph of insight once a week</a> because I loved having quotes emailed to me.</p>

<p>There you have it, four new ways to consume the news. If you love using NewsBlur and want to see it continue to launch new features like these, please tell friends and followers about your news reader. People often ask for ways to stay on top of the game and NewsBlur is the most powerful way to do it.</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.newsblur.com/2017/05/23/newsblur-now-supports-the-new-json-feed-spec/">
      <![CDATA[<p>Introduced and announced only last week by open web pioneers Manton Reece and Brent Simmons, JSON Feed is a new RSS-like spec that lets websites publish their stories in a much easier and human readable format.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://jsonfeed.org">JSON Feed spec</a> authors:</p>

<p>We — Manton Reece and Brent Simmons — have noticed that JSON has become the developers’ choice for APIs, and that developers will often go out of their way to avoid XML. JSON is simpler to read and write, and it’s less prone to bugs.</p>

<p><strong>Starting today, NewsBlur now officially supports the new JSON Feed spec</strong>. And there’s nothing extra you have to do. This means if a website syndicates their stories with the easy-to-write and easy-to-read JSON format, you can read it on NewsBlur. It should make no difference to you, since you’re reading the end product. But to website developers everywhere, supporting JSON Feeds is so much easier than supporting XML-based RSS/Atom.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/json-feeds.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Daring Fireball, as pictured above, supports the new JSON Feed. To you, the reader, it should look no different than any other RSS feed. But to the developer, publishing this as a JSON Feed instead of XML is an order of magnitude easier and quicker.</p>

<p>This spec is a terrific effort by open web advocates to make it easier to keep the web open and free by lowering the cost to writing and publishing.</p>

<p>Try it for yourself, just subscribe to this feed: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/json">https://daringfireball.net/feeds/json</a>. Even viewing it in a web browser is more pleasant than its <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/main">XML counterpart</a>.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Ever wanted to customize NewsBlur on the web but didn’t want to install custom browser extensions so you could shoe-horn in monkey-patched code? And if you did use a browser extension, didn’t you just hate having to keep it synchronized between your computers? Just for you, NewsBlur now has two new fields: Custom CSS and Custom Javascript.</p>

<p>Head to <em>Manage &gt; Account &gt; Custom CSS/JS</em>. And here’s what you can do with this new feature.</p>

<p><strong>Install an unofficial dark theme for NewsBlur</strong></p>

<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="960" data-orig-width="1098" data-orig-src="https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/124890_after.png"><img style="width: 650px;" data-orig-height="960" data-orig-width="1098" src="https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/124890_after.png" /></figure>

<p>Over on Stylish, a community for custom CSS, there are <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/browse?search_terms=newsblur">a bunch of stylesheets that change how NewsBlur looks</a>. Have you ever wanted a dark theme? There’s a few and <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/124890/newsblur-dark-theme-by-splike">the most popular is made by NewsBlur user Splike</a>. (Note: you will have to remove the @moz delcaraction along with the surrounding {}’s at the top and bottom lines.)</p>

<p><strong>Hide that module or link that you don’t want to see on NewsBlur</strong></p>

<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1033" data-orig-width="1300" data-orig-src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/custom-css.png"><img style="width: 650px;" data-orig-height="1033" data-orig-width="1300" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/custom-css.png" /></figure>

<p>Don’t like seeing Global Shared Stories or the River of News on the Dashboard? You can hide them with this little bit of CSS:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/* Hides the Global Shared Stories feed */
.NB-feeds-header-river-global-container { 
    display: none !important; 
}

/* Hides the Dashboard River */
.NB-module-river {
    display: none !important;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Run a custom script</strong></p>

<p>Ok, to be 100% truthful, I have no idea why you’d want to run custom JavaScript on NewsBlur. But if you figure out a reason please let me know! Either <a href="http://samuel@newsblur.com">shoot me an email</a> or mention it to <a href="https://twitter.com/newsblur">@newsblur on Twitter</a>.</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.newsblur.com/2017/05/09/newsblurs-twitter-support-just-got-a-whole-lot/">
      <![CDATA[<p>It was a little under a year ago that I declared <a href="http://blog.newsblur.com/2021/06/21/2016-06-01-twitters-back-baby.html">Twitter back, baby</a> on this blog. In that time, NewsBlur users have created over 80,000 Twitter feeds in NewsBlur. Since it’s such a popular feature, I decided to dive back into the code and make tweets look a whole lot better.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/twitter_upgrade.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Notice that NewsBlur now natively supports expanding truncated URLs (no more t.co links).</p>

<p>And NewsBlur also supports native quoted tweets, where a user links to a tweet in their own tweet. NewsBlur expands the quoted tweet and blockquotes it for convenience.</p>

<p>Plus retweets now show both the original tweet author and the retweeting author. This means that you can quickly scan tweets and see where the retweet originated from. And retweeted tweets that quote their own tweets also get expanded.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/twitter_retweets.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It’s almost as if NewsBlur is inching closer and closer to becoming its own full fledged Twitter client. While NewsBlur already hit <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/Z/Zawinskis-Law.html">Zawinski’s Law</a> (“Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.”) by supporting <a href="http://blog.newsblur.com/2021/06/21/2016-07-01-newsletters-in-your-newsblur.html">email-newsletters-to-rss</a>, Twitter is coming up fast.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I have this idea I’ve been noodling about better supporting Twitter habits that need to become less of a habit. I want to be able to automatically follow people from my Twitter tweetstream in NewsBlur based the frequency of their posting. I want to be able to infrequently dip into Twitter but still read the tweets from people who only post once a week or once a day.</p>

<p>In other words, I want Twitter, the RSS killer, to better integrate with an RSS reader so that I can pull out the good stuff from the unending flow of tweets. RSS means never missing anything, but Twitter’s main use case is anathema to how we use RSS. I don’t like to preannounce features, but this one intrigues me and if you agree, please share this story to let me know or to give me feedback on how you would like to see NewsBlur be a better Twitter client.</p>

<p>Saved searches are great for creating custom feeds with just the stories you want. Think of these new feeds as spotlights on parts of a folder or feed, ways to keep track of stories that share a theme across different sites.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p><strong>This is it, the final countdown!</strong></p>

<p>Tonight at 8pm PT the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samuelclay/turn-touch-beautiful-control/">Turn Touch campaign</a> will end and the project will be successfully funded. Judging from the $50,000 raised already, I think Turn Touch has a long life ahead of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samuelclay/turn-touch-beautiful-control/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/turntouch/animated-newsblur-live.gif" alt="" /></a></p>

<h5 id="watch-the-2-minute-demo-on-vimeo"><a href="https://vimeo.com/207556527">Watch the 2 minute demo on Vimeo</a></h5>

<p>Apart from being the only remote control in the world built for a news reader, Turn Touch is the handiest shortcut for your lights, music, and apps. It’s basically a customizable remote with a knack for smart homes.</p>

<p>Supporting Turn Touch is a way of supporting NewsBlur. They are part of the same suite of productivity tools made by the <a href="https://twitter.com/samuelclay">same person</a>. By buying a Turn Touch and backing this Kickstarter, you’re continuing to fund the development of great tools.</p>

<p>So please <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samuelclay/turn-touch-beautiful-control/">head to Kickstarter and buy yourself the $59 mahogany remote</a>, even if you do not yet have any smart home devices. This remote is the easiest way to start connecting your home.</p>

<p><a href="https://turntouch.com/kickstarter">Turn Touch</a> is a solid wood remote… and it’s about to change the way you use NewsBlur.</p>

<p><strong>Change how?</strong></p>

<p>Here’s how. Turn Touch connects to apps and devices in your home. Think Hue lights and Sonos speakers. Your Mac, your phone, etc.</p>

<p>It also connects to NewsBlur.</p>

<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="760" data-orig-width="1360" data-orig-src="https://turntouch.com/static/images/media-kit/graphics/use-case-news@2x.jpg"><img style="width: 650px;border: 1px solid #909090;" data-orig-height="760" data-orig-width="1360" src="https://turntouch.com/static/images/media-kit/graphics/use-case-news@2x.jpg" /></figure>

<p>This is big. It means you can wake up in the morning, grab a cup of coffee, and cycle through news from across the room. Or, hook your Mac up to a display (maybe your living room TV) and skip through photo blogs, headlines, and the day’s best writing.</p>

<p>It’s kind of like getting a new set of speakers. Where before, you’d be chained to your computer with headphones; now, you can listen to music from anywhere you’d like. With Turn Touch, you can leave your computer and read the news no matter what you’re doing— laundry, the dishes, or enjoying a lazy Sunday on your couch.</p>

<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="877" data-orig-width="2000" data-orig-src="https://turntouch.com/static/images/media-kit/photos/Turn%20Touch-3248c.jpg"><img style="width: 650px;border: 1px solid #909090;" data-orig-height="877" data-orig-width="2000" src="https://turntouch.com/static/images/media-kit/photos/Turn%20Touch-3248c.jpg" /></figure>

<p><strong>Get one. Or all three.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://turntouch.com/kickstarter">Turn Touch is on Kickstarter</a>. Back the project to get your very own. Or—and this is my sincere recommendation—get the complete set, save some money, and give one away to a friend.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on Turn Touch for years and I hope it shows.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>I have something very exciting to share with you today. I’ve been working on a secret project called Turn Touch and I’m just about ready to show it to you. <a href="https://www.turntouch.com">Signup on turntouch.com</a> to find out.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.turntouch.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/turntouch/blog-preview-blur.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>It’s a new kind of device and it’s machined out of solid wood. I built it to last, much like my other projects (for instance the news reader you’re likely reading this in). Turn Touch is built for NewsBlur, among many other things.</p>

<p>Turn Touch will be launching on Kickstarter next week and I want to ask for your help. When I launch my campaign I’m going to need people like you to share it with people who look to you for recomendations on what’s good. You already use NewsBlur, so you’re already known for having good taste.</p>

<p>Now, you probably want to know what Turn Touch is and actually looks like, yeah? Then <a href="https://www.turntouch.com">signup on turntouch.com</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll get to preview the Kickstarter campaign and offer me any feedback you have. You’ll get to see Turn Touch and find out what it offers you.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on this as a side project for that past few years. And by signing up you’ll have the first access to it.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>This is a seriously cool feature and I’m glad it’s ready to launch. The dashboard river, the real-time stream of the top five stories of All Site Stories, is now on the dashboard of the web app.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/dashboard-river.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After testing this feature for the past few weeks I now realize that I could not live without it. By having the latest stories always loaded and instantly ready to go, I leave NewsBlur open and just take a quick glance to see if the top of my list is interesting.</p>

<p>It also loads instantly, which means that if you see a story you want to read, clicking on it brings up the text without taking a single moment.</p>

<p>One big change that this necessitated was the handling of the Text view when reading by folders. Used to be that a folder got its own feed/text/story view and every feed had to stay with the same story view. But on iOS and Android it’s different. Every feed gets to keep its own feed/text/story setting.</p>

<p>This is now how it works on the web. If you read on feed by its Text (extracted original text) view and another by its Feed view, then you are automatically switched between the two views. Quite a bit of logic had to accomodate scrolling (you don’t automatically switch, since that would throw you from one scroll viewport into another) and switching between stories.</p>

<p>Enjoy the dashboard river. And if you look closely you might even see the next big feature that itself is about to launch soon.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>It’s been three years to the day that Google Reader shut down. And here’s a feature they could never build. Introducing email newsletters in your RSS reader.</p>

<p>You can now forward your email newsletters over to NewsBlur and then read your email newsletters right in your browser/phone/TV/tablet. A couple dozen users have been beta testing this feature for the last couple of months and everybody agrees, this feature is amazing.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/newsletters.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Newsletters are formatted to fit all of your screens, so it looks just as good on the web as it does on your phone.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/newsletters-ios.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here’s the best part. If you get a lot of newsletters, you can group them into folders and even train them to highlight the newsletters you want to read first.</p>

<p>Setting up newsletters on NewsBlur is easy. Just follow the personalized instructions on the web by going to Manage &gt; Email Newsletters on either the web dashboard or the manage menu.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/newsletters-setup.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You might ask why not just subscribe your custom NewsBlur newsletter email address directly to the newsletter instead of forwarding copies of the newsletter. The answer is that if you want a single source of truth for where newsletters are going, you want that in your email client and not on NewsBlur. If you ever change news readers (and with new features like this, why would you want to) you’ll want to change only a single filter rule instead of dozens of newsletter emails.</p>

<p>And with this huge new feature, NewsBlur just became even better. NewsBlur has branched beyond RSS for a while now, fetching Twitter and YouTube stories even without RSS. With newsletters, NewsBlur becomes your single source.</p>

<p>If you have suggestions on what NewsBlur can help you read next, post an idea on the <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur">Get Satisfaction forums</a>.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>It’s been too long. Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2013/api-v1-retirement-final-dates">unceremoniously knee-capped their API</a> a few years ago and a number of solutions popped up to fix the loss. However, those stopgaps also closed and left us with no good ways to read Twitter while in NewsBlur. Until now, that is.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/twitter_api.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can now subscribe to <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/">https://twitter.com/</a><em>username</em></strong> to get individual Twitter accounts on NewsBlur. Put them all in a folder to recreate your tweetstream.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/twitter_add.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Not only do you get the full tweetstream for that user, but you can also filter out tweets that are replies, retweets, or contain any text in them. You can also train Twitter feeds to highlight tweets that contain photos, are retweeted or liked, or have a word you want.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/twitter_training.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>YouTube also deprecated their API and NewsBlur came to the rescue with <a href="http://blog.newsblur.com/2021/06/21/2015-04-30-a-real-solution-to-the-deprecated-youtube-api.html">native YouTube API support</a>. Now Twitter joins that list of native support, giving you a better Twitter experience than ever before.</p>

<p>And because this native Twitter support takes more work than normal RSS feeds do, this feature is only available to premium subscribers.</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.newsblur.com/2016/04/12/newsblur-goes-dark-on-ios/">
      <![CDATA[<p>It’s like a whole new app. There’s so much to tell you about in the latest release of the NewsBlur iOS app. This is the release of all releases.</p>

<p>The biggest addition are the new themes. We have a total of four themes now: white, sepia, grey, and dark.</p>

<p>The dark theme is for when the lights are low (or off) and you want to read without disturbing anybody around you.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios-v6-dark.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The grey theme gives you the best of both worlds. It’s a dark theme that gives you low light, but still bright enough to easily see.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios-v6-grey.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sepia is the paperback you carry around everywhere so you always have something to read. Preparation pays.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios-v6-sepia.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The iPad Pro gets full support and that means that keyboard shortcuts have been instrumented all over the app.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios-v6-keyboard.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Maybe you’re thinking about how much the app just advanced. Maybe you’ve been waiting a long, long time for a dark theme ever since Android got it a year ago. Who knows, maybe you’re 100% on your iphone and that there’s just one or two tasks that you still need the website for.</p>

<p>Get ready for this. The Organizer is now on the iOS app. And this isn’t just any organizer. You can see all of your feeds, sorted in or out of their folders, ordered by number of subscribers, how often you read them, how often they publish, and even how recently they published.</p>

<p>Use these lists to find feeds that no longer publish or the feeds that publish too much. Move and delete whole groups of feeds at once. This organizer is the real deal. Try finding this feature anywhere else.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios-v6-organizer.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And if there’s an organizer, that means there’s a way to mute and unmute sites directly from your iPhone.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios-v6-mute.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s plenty of other new features too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New icons app-wide</li>
  <li>New menus for deleting and muting feeds</li>
  <li>Custom domain support</li>
  <li>Mark all as read by long pressing</li>
  <li>Search and Subscribe improvements</li>
</ul>

<p>And check it out, NewsBlur now has two additional developers working on the iOS app, David Sinclair and Nicholas Riley. They have worked for the last few months on making this update the biggest yet. <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/about">Their mugs are now on the About page</a> and I’m extremely pleased with their work. Nicholas built the keyboard support that iPad Pro owners will appreciate. And David gives us the new themes, new organizer, and all of the other goodies we’ve got.</p>

<p>This is the one to beat.</p>

But I felt it was time for an upgrade and today I’m pleased to launch some changes to the story tracker.</p>

<p>If you use a third-party client to read NewsBlur, like Reeder, ReadKit, or Unread, you may have noticed strange <ins style="text-decoration: underline;color: #006600">revision</ins> change highlighters that cross out what gets edited out by a publisher and highlights what gets added.</p>

<p>This is great, except you probably don’t want this turned on for every single story.</p>

<p>By default you will now only see the final edit of the story. And if you are on the web you will see a new Show Story Changes button in the heading of any story that has seen changes.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/show_changes_button.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can also toggle back and forth between showing and hiding story changes, so you can take a peek behind the curtains and still come back to the read the story in its final, finished form.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/show_changes.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This should relieve the burden of having to implement a story change tracker in third-party clients when almost no other news readers have this feature. So third-party reading app makers neglected to include support, leading to a less than ideal NewsBlur reading experience. No longer!</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>The iOS app has enjoyed a feature that gives you a tiny preview of a story’s main image right in the story title. Today this feature launches on the web.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/inline_images.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What I’ve noticed is that while I don’t use the image to identify which stories I want to read, I do use them to act as a signature of a story.</p>

<p>There’s precedence for this on NewsBlur. Every site already does this using the color of its favicon. NewsBlur liberally applies a two-tone color palette based on each feed’s favicon. This serves as a per-feed signature, giving context to a story when it’s in the same view as every other feed’s stories.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/inline_images_left.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>These story preview thumbnails serve as the same signature. Stories are best remembered through their colors and photos, so thumbnails act as a visual signature that’s easy to recognize. It works on a subconscious but perceptable level.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/inline_images_pref.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Of course you can turn them right off.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>NewsBlur has an amazingly active third-party app community, thanks to the <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/api">well documented NewsBlur API</a>. Today I’d like to introduce you to two new apps built by developers on the NewsBlur API.</p>

<h2 id="hypersonic-for-windows-10--windows-phone">Hypersonic for Windows 10 &amp; Windows Phone</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/hypersonic/9nblggh5wnb6">Hypersonic</a> is clean, simple, beautiful, and designed to run across both mobile and desktop devices.</p>

<h2 id="add-my-feed-for-ios">Add My Feed for iOS</h2>

<p><a href="http://addmyfeed.cubesoft.fr">Add My Feed</a> is an extension allowing you to effortlessly add RSS feeds to your online reader of choice.</p>

<p>When you encounter a site you would like to subscribe to, simply tap the Add My Feed extension and you’re done !</p>

<p>Add My Feed works in Safari and in any app supporting the standard iOS share sheet.</p>

<p>Both of these apps and many more are on the <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/?next=goodies">Goodies &amp; Mobile Apps</a> dialog. If you’ve developed an app for NewsBlur and would like to add it to Goodies (and have it blogged about here), let me know!</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.newsblur.com/2016/01/15/improved-statistics/">
      <![CDATA[<p>That’s why I’m pleased to introduce more advanced statistics for every single feed. The Statistics dialog now shows a heat graph of the times of day that stories are published as well as the days of the weeks.</p>

<p>Take a look at the NewsBlur support feed, which you can subscribe to here: <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/site/644144/get-satisfaction-for-newsblur">http://www.newsblur.com/site/644144/get-satisfaction-for-newsblur</a></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/stats_getsatisfaction.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can see the post-Google Reader shutdown bump starting in March 2013 and will notice that most of NewsBlur’s support happens during the week. (I like to take weekends off and work on side projects and the occasional NewsBlur feature.) But due to NewsBlur’s international audience, support comes in at all hours of the day.</p>

<p>And of course one of NewsBlur’s most popular publishers is Kottke.org, home of fine hypertext products. You can subscribe to kottke.org here: <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/site/39/kottke.org.">http://www.newsblur.com/site/39/kottke.org.</a></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/stats_kottke.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Amazingly, over the lifetime of NewsBlur’s statistics feature (which launched originally in 2010), Jason Kottke has been both prolific and regular in his postings of what’s good on the web. He sticks to a 9-5 schedule and works only on weekdays.</p>

<p>Anything else you’d like to see on the statistics panel? Post an idea over on <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur">NewsBlur’s Get Satisfaction support site</a>.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Every NewsBlur client, from the three official clients (web, iOS, and Android) to all third-party clients, should now be showing better embeds for Twitter, Instagram, and Imgur. Just take a look at these screenshots.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/android_oembed_instagram.png" alt="" /> <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios_oembed_instagram.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And don’t forget that even YouTube gets special treatment on all three platforms. Here on the web, you can see that YouTube videos are automatically expanded to fill the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/oembed_web_youtube.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So there you go, enjoy the new embeds (also called oEmbeds, whatever that means). And if you have any suggestions for new embeds, just submit an idea to <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur.">http://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur.</a></p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Holy geez, this is a whopper of a release. Version 5.0 of the NewsBlur iOS app has lots and lots of new features, fixes for some long standing issues, and major performance improvements for reading stories.</p>

<p>The biggest new feature to hit the iOS app is the introduction of premium fonts from type foundry Hoefler &amp; Co. Whitney, Gotham Narrow, and Chronicle have been added to give NewsBlur a more pleasurable reading experience. Take a look for yourself.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios9_fonts.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Comment-less shares have also been added to the iOS app. You can now share a story and your friends can now reply without you having to write anything first, just like on the web and on the Android app.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios9_share.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here’s the full list of new features and improvements. Make a cup of tea first because this list is a doozy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The app has been iOS 9-ified.</li>
  <li>The iOS app now has the same great fonts from the web: Whitney, Gotham Narrow, and Chronicle. These each look fantastic.</li>
  <li>The Text view is now sticky based on the last view you used. It’s per feed but it also respects individual feeds when reading by folder. This is unlike the web, where the Text view matches the feed or folder. Now it’s sticky to the feed, which makes it much easier to read through a folder of stories.</li>
  <li>When switching between the Text view and Story view, the loading indicator is now at the bottom of the screen instead of directly on top of the story.</li>
  <li>Stories now remember your last scroll position. When you go back to a story, you are taken back to the same place you left off.</li>
  <li>New Safari-based browser for the original story. These views are faster and support content blockers on iOS 9 and use your browser’s cookies. However, they look like Safari and not NewsBlur, so the default in-app browser is the original browser. The new in-app Safari browser is a preference, along with Chrome, Opera, and the full Safari app.</li>
  <li>A new option to mark stories as read when they are scrolled past. Defaults to off.</li>
  <li>Sending stories to third-party services now uses full Text if available. Useful for storing full story text in Evernote or Pocket.</li>
  <li>Comment-less shares are now supported, allowing you to reply to shared stories that have no comment.</li>
  <li>The feed trainer now shows trained titles.</li>
  <li>1Password integration on login.</li>
  <li>iPad Pro is now supported.</li>
  <li>Date and times of stories now uses the system locale, so everybody who isn’t in the U.S. will see dates as they should be.</li>
  <li>3D Touch actions: Add site, all site stories, search stories.</li>
  <li>Voiceover support.</li>
  <li>iOS 8 is the minimum supported version for this release.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hot dog that’s a lot in one release. Version 5.0 is now ready for you. <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/ios">Download it for free on the App Store</a>.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>If you like living on the bleeding edge, you should join the NewsBlur iOS beta program. You’ll get access to the latest releases a few weeks before they go out publicly.</p>

<p>All you need to do is add your email address to this form: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XSerwoY-PEJ7JfglNr0zOKpsoMXqplSomdORSDsZ3_g/viewform?usp=send_form">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XSerwoY-PEJ7JfglNr0zOKpsoMXqplSomdORSDsZ3_g/viewform?usp=send_form</a></p>

<p>You might be wondering why this is a bit different than the older method used in the past. The old beta program used an enterprise distribution provision profile, which was available as a workaround to install apps on devices without having to go through the App Store. Unfortunately that program has ended and Apple now recommends using their new TestFlight beta program.</p>

<p>In order to use TestFlight, email addresses of interested beta testers need to be collected. But the benefit is that you can now easily move between beta and release versions. You will also automatically upgrade to the release version when it comes out. You can also give feedback in a more accurate way, with your device and OS version automatically added to anything you write as feedback.</p>

<p>So if you want to try out the latest betas, specifically for iOS 9 and a whole bundle of new features, then add your email to that list and watch your inbox. It can take up to a couple days for these emails to be imported, so be patient.</p>
