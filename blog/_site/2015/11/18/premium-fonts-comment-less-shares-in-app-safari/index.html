    <p>Holy geez, this is a whopper of a release. Version 5.0 of the NewsBlur iOS app has lots and lots of new features, fixes for some long standing issues, and major performance improvements for reading stories.</p>

<p>The biggest new feature to hit the iOS app is the introduction of premium fonts from type foundry Hoefler &amp; Co. Whitney, Gotham Narrow, and Chronicle have been added to give NewsBlur a more pleasurable reading experience. Take a look for yourself.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios9_fonts.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Comment-less shares have also been added to the iOS app. You can now share a story and your friends can now reply without you having to write anything first, just like on the web and on the Android app.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios9_share.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here’s the full list of new features and improvements. Make a cup of tea first because this list is a doozy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The app has been iOS 9-ified.</li>
  <li>The iOS app now has the same great fonts from the web: Whitney, Gotham Narrow, and Chronicle. These each look fantastic.</li>
  <li>The Text view is now sticky based on the last view you used. It’s per feed but it also respects individual feeds when reading by folder. This is unlike the web, where the Text view matches the feed or folder. Now it’s sticky to the feed, which makes it much easier to read through a folder of stories.</li>
  <li>When switching between the Text view and Story view, the loading indicator is now at the bottom of the screen instead of directly on top of the story.</li>
  <li>Stories now remember your last scroll position. When you go back to a story, you are taken back to the same place you left off.</li>
  <li>New Safari-based browser for the original story. These views are faster and support content blockers on iOS 9 and use your browser’s cookies. However, they look like Safari and not NewsBlur, so the default in-app browser is the original browser. The new in-app Safari browser is a preference, along with Chrome, Opera, and the full Safari app.</li>
  <li>A new option to mark stories as read when they are scrolled past. Defaults to off.</li>
  <li>Sending stories to third-party services now uses full Text if available. Useful for storing full story text in Evernote or Pocket.</li>
  <li>Comment-less shares are now supported, allowing you to reply to shared stories that have no comment.</li>
  <li>The feed trainer now shows trained titles.</li>
  <li>1Password integration on login.</li>
  <li>iPad Pro is now supported.</li>
  <li>Date and times of stories now uses the system locale, so everybody who isn’t in the U.S. will see dates as they should be.</li>
  <li>3D Touch actions: Add site, all site stories, search stories.</li>
  <li>Voiceover support.</li>
  <li>iOS 8 is the minimum supported version for this release.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hot dog that’s a lot in one release. Version 5.0 is now ready for you. <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/ios">Download it for free on the App Store</a>.</p>
