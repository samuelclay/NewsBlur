        <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p><strong>This is it, the final countdown!</strong></p>

<p>Tonight at 8pm PT the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samuelclay/turn-touch-beautiful-control/">Turn Touch campaign</a> will end and the project will be successfully funded. Judging from the $50,000 raised already, I think Turn Touch has a long life ahead of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samuelclay/turn-touch-beautiful-control/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/turntouch/animated-newsblur-live.gif" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Apart from being the only remote control in the world built for a news reader, Turn Touch is the handiest shortcut for your lights, music, and apps. It’s basically a customizable remote with a knack for smart homes.</p>

<p>Supporting Turn Touch is a way of supporting NewsBlur. They are part of the same suite of productivity tools made by the <a href="https://twitter.com/samuelclay">same person</a>. By buying a Turn Touch and backing this Kickstarter, you’re continuing to fund the development of great tools.</p>

<p>So please <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/samuelclay/turn-touch-beautiful-control/">head to Kickstarter and buy yourself the $59 mahogany remote</a>, even if you do not yet have any smart home devices. This remote is the easiest way to start connecting your home.</p>

<p><a href="https://turntouch.com/kickstarter">Turn Touch</a> is a solid wood remote… and it’s about to change the way you use NewsBlur.</p>

<p><strong>Change how?</strong></p>

<p>Here’s how. Turn Touch connects to apps and devices in your home. Think Hue lights and Sonos speakers. Your Mac, your phone, etc.</p>

<p>It also connects to NewsBlur.</p>

<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="760" data-orig-width="1360" data-orig-src="https://turntouch.com/static/images/media-kit/graphics/use-case-news@2x.jpg"><img style="width: 650px;border: 1px solid #909090;" data-orig-height="760" data-orig-width="1360" src="https://turntouch.com/static/images/media-kit/graphics/use-case-news@2x.jpg" /></figure>

<p>This is big. It means you can wake up in the morning, grab a cup of coffee, and cycle through news from across the room. Or, hook your Mac up to a display (maybe your living room TV) and skip through photo blogs, headlines, and the day’s best writing.</p>

<p>It’s kind of like getting a new set of speakers. Where before, you’d be chained to your computer with headphones; now, you can listen to music from anywhere you’d like. With Turn Touch, you can leave your computer and read the news no matter what you’re doing— laundry, the dishes, or enjoying a lazy Sunday on your couch.</p>

<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="877" data-orig-width="2000" data-orig-src="https://turntouch.com/static/images/media-kit/photos/Turn%20Touch-3248c.jpg"><img style="width: 650px;border: 1px solid #909090;" data-orig-height="877" data-orig-width="2000" src="https://turntouch.com/static/images/media-kit/photos/Turn%20Touch-3248c.jpg" /></figure>

<p><strong>Get one. Or all three.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://turntouch.com/kickstarter">Turn Touch is on Kickstarter</a>. Back the project to get your very own. Or—and this is my sincere recommendation—get the complete set, save some money, and give one away to a friend.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on Turn Touch for years and I hope it shows.</p>

          <p>I have something very exciting to share with you today. I’ve been working on a secret project called Turn Touch and I’m just about ready to show it to you. <a href="https://www.turntouch.com">Signup on turntouch.com</a> to find out.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.turntouch.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/turntouch/blog-preview-blur.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>It’s a new kind of device and it’s machined out of solid wood. I built it to last, much like my other projects (for instance the news reader you’re likely reading this in). Turn Touch is built for NewsBlur, among many other things.</p>

<p>Turn Touch will be launching on Kickstarter next week and I want to ask for your help. When I launch my campaign I’m going to need people like you to share it with people who look to you for recomendations on what’s good. You already use NewsBlur, so you’re already known for having good taste.</p>

<p>Now, you probably want to know what Turn Touch is and actually looks like, yeah? Then <a href="https://www.turntouch.com">signup on turntouch.com</a>.</p>

<p>You’ll get to preview the Kickstarter campaign and offer me any feedback you have. You’ll get to see Turn Touch and find out what it offers you.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on this as a side project for that past few years. And by signing up you’ll have the first access to it.</p>

        </h3>
        <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>This is a seriously cool feature and I’m glad it’s ready to launch. The dashboard river, the real-time stream of the top five stories of All Site Stories, is now on the dashboard of the web app.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/dashboard-river.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After testing this feature for the past few weeks I now realize that I could not live without it. By having the latest stories always loaded and instantly ready to go, I leave NewsBlur open and just take a quick glance to see if the top of my list is interesting.</p>

<p>It also loads instantly, which means that if you see a story you want to read, clicking on it brings up the text without taking a single moment.</p>

<p>One big change that this necessitated was the handling of the Text view when reading by folders. Used to be that a folder got its own feed/text/story view and every feed had to stay with the same story view. But on iOS and Android it’s different. Every feed gets to keep its own feed/text/story setting.</p>

<p>This is now how it works on the web. If you read on feed by its Text (extracted original text) view and another by its Feed view, then you are automatically switched between the two views. Quite a bit of logic had to accomodate scrolling (you don’t automatically switch, since that would throw you from one scroll viewport into another) and switching between stories.</p>

<p>Enjoy the dashboard river. And if you look closely you might even see the next big feature that itself is about to launch soon.</p>

<p>You can read your subscriptions as well as subscribe to new sites, right from your television.</p>

          <p>It’s been three years to the day that Google Reader shut down. And here’s a feature they could never build. Introducing email newsletters in your RSS reader.</p>

<p>You can now forward your email newsletters over to NewsBlur and then read your email newsletters right in your browser/phone/TV/tablet. A couple dozen users have been beta testing this feature for the last couple of months and everybody agrees, this feature is amazing.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/newsletters.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Newsletters are formatted to fit all of your screens, so it looks just as good on the web as it does on your phone.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/newsletters-ios.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here’s the best part. If you get a lot of newsletters, you can group them into folders and even train them to highlight the newsletters you want to read first.</p>

<p>Setting up newsletters on NewsBlur is easy. Just follow the personalized instructions on the web by going to Manage &gt; Email Newsletters on either the web dashboard or the manage menu.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/newsletters-setup.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You might ask why not just subscribe your custom NewsBlur newsletter email address directly to the newsletter instead of forwarding copies of the newsletter. The answer is that if you want a single source of truth for where newsletters are going, you want that in your email client and not on NewsBlur. If you ever change news readers (and with new features like this, why would you want to) you’ll want to change only a single filter rule instead of dozens of newsletter emails.</p>

<p>And with this huge new feature, NewsBlur just became even better. NewsBlur has branched beyond RSS for a while now, fetching Twitter and YouTube stories even without RSS. With newsletters, NewsBlur becomes your single source.</p>

        <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>It’s been too long. Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2013/api-v1-retirement-final-dates">unceremoniously knee-capped their API</a> a few years ago and a number of solutions popped up to fix the loss. However, those stopgaps also closed and left us with no good ways to read Twitter while in NewsBlur. Until now, that is.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/twitter_api.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can now subscribe to <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/">https://twitter.com/</a><em>username</em></strong> to get individual Twitter accounts on NewsBlur. Put them all in a folder to recreate your tweetstream.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/twitter_add.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Not only do you get the full tweetstream for that user, but you can also filter out tweets that are replies, retweets, or contain any text in them. You can also train Twitter feeds to highlight tweets that contain photos, are retweeted or liked, or have a word you want.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/twitter_training.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>YouTube also deprecated their API and NewsBlur came to the rescue with <a href="http://blog.newsblur.com/2021/06/21/2015-04-30-a-real-solution-to-the-deprecated-youtube-api.html">native YouTube API support</a>. Now Twitter joins that list of native support, giving you a better Twitter experience than ever before.</p>

<p>And because this native Twitter support takes more work than normal RSS feeds do, this feature is only available to premium subscribers.</p>

          </a>
        </h3>
        <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>It’s like a whole new app. There’s so much to tell you about in the latest release of the NewsBlur iOS app. This is the release of all releases.</p>

<p>The biggest addition are the new themes. We have a total of four themes now: white, sepia, grey, and dark.</p>

<p>The dark theme is for when the lights are low (or off) and you want to read without disturbing anybody around you.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios-v6-dark.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The grey theme gives you the best of both worlds. It’s a dark theme that gives you low light, but still bright enough to easily see.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios-v6-grey.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sepia is the paperback you carry around everywhere so you always have something to read. Preparation pays.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios-v6-sepia.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The iPad Pro gets full support and that means that keyboard shortcuts have been instrumented all over the app.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios-v6-keyboard.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Maybe you’re thinking about how much the app just advanced. Maybe you’ve been waiting a long, long time for a dark theme ever since Android got it a year ago. Who knows, maybe you’re 100% on your iphone and that there’s just one or two tasks that you still need the website for.</p>

<p>Get ready for this. The Organizer is now on the iOS app. And this isn’t just any organizer. You can see all of your feeds, sorted in or out of their folders, ordered by number of subscribers, how often you read them, how often they publish, and even how recently they published.</p>

<p>Use these lists to find feeds that no longer publish or the feeds that publish too much. Move and delete whole groups of feeds at once. This organizer is the real deal. Try finding this feature anywhere else.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios-v6-organizer.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And if there’s an organizer, that means there’s a way to mute and unmute sites directly from your iPhone.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/ios-v6-mute.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s plenty of other new features too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New icons app-wide</li>
  <li>New menus for deleting and muting feeds</li>
  <li>Custom domain support</li>
  <li>Mark all as read by long pressing</li>
  <li>Search and Subscribe improvements</li>
</ul>

<p>And check it out, NewsBlur now has two additional developers working on the iOS app, David Sinclair and Nicholas Riley. They have worked for the last few months on making this update the biggest yet. <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/about">Their mugs are now on the About page</a> and I’m extremely pleased with their work. Nicholas built the keyboard support that iPad Pro owners will appreciate. And David gives us the new themes, new organizer, and all of the other goodies we’ve got.</p>

<p>This is the one to beat.</p>

          <p>As performance updates go, this month’s upgrade to v4.8.0 of the NewsBlur Android app is a doozy. This one’s specifically made for those users with a heavier load of feeds.</p>

<p>If you have over a hundred feeds, everything will suddenly feel smooth, just like it already does for those with only a few dozen subscriptions. And if you find yourself climbing up to several hundred feeds from only a dozen, you’ll be in good company.</p>
