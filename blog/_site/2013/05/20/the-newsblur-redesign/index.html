    <p>Not to say that NewsBlur was <em>ugly</em> before today, but it certainly didn’t have the loving embrace of a talented designer. So without waiting another moment (or month) I proudly present the NewsBlur redesign.</p>

<p><img src="http://dev.newsblur.com/media/img/welcome/header-web.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>It’s a full scale redesign, too. And not just one of those redesigns where the icons get glossier and fonts, bolder. Every moving piece of machinery got more than a coat of paint. A number of new crucial reading features have been added. Some features were merged, some were repaired, and some were scrapped.</p>

<p>Dashboard before &amp; after:</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/before_dashboard.png" alt="image" /> <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newsblur.com/blog/after_dashboard.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Reading before &amp; after:</p>

<p>In no particular order, here’s what’s new:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unified interactions/activities popover. Gets out of your way and gives the dashboard more room to breath.</li>
  <li>Rewritten feed loader, offering incredible performance, even at the 20x scale of today vs 2 months ago before the Google Reader announcement.</li>
  <li>Custom vector graphics, retina-fying the entire site.</li>
  <li>Increased transparency of sites by showing more detail in feed fetching/statistics.</li>
  <li>A new List view to complement the Split view for stories.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s just for the website. The iOS app, Android app, and blurblogs all got the update goodness that has graced the web app.</p>

<p><img src="http://dev.newsblur.com/media/img/welcome/header-ios.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>As for what’s happening these days, post-Reader:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Took some extra time to scale out my backend, now completed.</li>
  <li>Running on 48 servers, serving 20x traffic</li>
  <li>Because I had the foresight to charge users for premium service, I’m now confident that NewsBlur will be standing tall a few years from now.</li>
  <li>Working on the next few big ticket features: saved story search and tagging, batch editing organizer, keyboard shortcut manager, and more.</li>
</ul>

  <p>Biggest unanticipated consequence of the Reader shutdown – I no longer have to wear a jacket in SF because my core temperature has risen.</p>

<p>And if you’re new to NewsBlur, here’s the six core benefits to using the one with the Sun:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Training</strong> - hide the stories you don’t like and highlight the stories you do. Make mincemeat out of heavy feeds and make sure to never miss stories from the feeds you love.</li>
  <li><strong>Original site</strong> - read a publisher’s stories the way they wanted you to read it - on the original website. NewsBlur embeds the publisher’s site in an iframe, and marks what you read as read as you scroll.</li>
  <li><strong>Text view</strong> - conveniently extracts the story text from articles, necessary for reading truncated rss feeds.</li>
  <li><strong>Blurblogs / sharing</strong> - a social community where you can share and discuss stories with friends.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed</strong> - A dedication to fast load times, graphed on your dashboard.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile</strong> - native, first-class iOS and Android apps, with all of the functionality of the website.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that the redesign has launched, I plan to blog about how to best use the intelligence trainer efficiently, all new [future] features, and how I was able to successfully scale out the four databases (count ‘em: postgresql, mongodb, redis, elasticsearch) to handle more than 10,000 users and 4 million site updates a day. It’s no Tumblr, but it’s still way more traffic than you can fit on a single machine.</p>

<p>Thanks for using NewsBlur and turning my passion project (four years running) into a full-time dream.</p>
