<p>Just click the little sprocket in the bottom left of your dashboard and select “Profile &amp; Blurblog,” where you’ll be given one of three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Public (default): The good old-fashioned oversharing you’ve come to know and love.</li>
  <li>Protected: Everyone can see your stories, but only approved NewsBlur followers can reply or comment to your shares. Continue to drop knowledge for a grateful public, minus the peanut gallery.</li>
  <li>Private: Only your approved followers can see your shares and comment. The outside world will never know about your love of bunny photos and animated GIFs. If you choose one of the latter two options, you’ll receive an e-mail every time someone requests to follow you, allowing you to carefully curate your inner circle. Want to remove any of your existing followers? Just visit their profile to boot them from blurblog access.</li>
</ul>

<p>Go forth and privatize! It’ll be our little secret, at least until we discover that one of you is having an affair with your biographer.</p>
