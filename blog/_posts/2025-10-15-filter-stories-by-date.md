title: Filter stories by date range

A few days ago was my five year wedding anniversary. I wanted to see the news from exactly five years ago, which I had clearly missed because I was not checking my phone that day. That's where the new date filter feature comes in handy.

You can now filter stories by date range, filtering stories down to only those newer or older than some date or between some timespan. This works on individual feeds and as well as on folders, saved stories, and read stories.

The date filter lives in the feed options popover, right where you'd expect it next to other feed filtering and ordering options. You'll see the new "Filter by date range" section with two sections: "Newer" and "Older".

Each column has a date input field where you can manually enter a date, or use the quick duration buttons for common time ranges. Want to see the past week? Click "1w" under "Newer". Want to see stories from a specific month? Set the "Newer" and "Older" dates to bracket that month.

This feature is particularly useful when you're catching up after being away, or when you want to research how some event in the past was covered. Combined with NewsBlur's full-text search, you can now both search for topics and filter by when they were published. And of course the [recently launched Discover feature](/2025/02/02/discover-related-stories-and-sites/) lets you see related stories and related feeds to follow interesting bunny trails.

The date filters work across all of NewsBlur's views - individual feeds, folders, saved stories, and the river of news. The filters don't persist between feeds, so you can set different date ranges for different feeds without the settings interfering with each other.

If you have any feedback or ideas for improvements, please share them on the <a href="https://forum.newsblur.com">NewsBlur forum</a>.
