title: "Introducing Premium Pro: high-frequency fetching for instant notifications"
tags: ["web"]
---

Some of you don't just read the news. You monitor it. You're tracking competitors, watching for security disclosures, following regulatory changes, or covering a beat where being 30 minutes late means you missed the story. NewsBlur has always been a great reader, but for people who need it to be a monitoring tool, I wanted to build something that takes feed fetching and filtering seriously.

Premium Pro is the new top tier. It includes everything in <a href="https://newsblur.com/pricing/archive">Premium Archive</a> and adds two things that matter when speed is the priority: high-frequency fetching and a 10,000 site limit. And when you pair that with Premium Archive features like classifier-driven notifications, Pro becomes a real-time monitoring system.

### Every feed fetched every 5 minutes

This is the headline feature. When you're on Pro, every single feed in your account is checked every 5 minutes. This isn't based on how often the feed publishes or how popular it is. It's every feed, every time, regardless.

For context, most RSS readers check feeds every hour or two. Even NewsBlur's Premium tier updates feeds up to 5x more often than standard, but Pro goes further. If a CVE drops, a competitor publishes a press release, or a regulatory filing appears, you'll see it in minutes, not hours.

### Notifications that actually keep up

Fast fetching only matters if you find out about new stories quickly. NewsBlur has a full notification system that pairs perfectly with Pro's 5-minute polling. You can enable notifications per feed and choose whether to be notified about all unread stories or only Focus stories that match your intelligence training.

Notifications go to every platform at once: iOS push notifications, Android push notifications, browser notifications on the web, Mac notifications, and email. Set up a few critical feeds with notifications enabled and you have a real-time alerting pipeline built on RSS.

### Classifier-driven notifications, supercharged by Pro

Premium Archive recently added the ability to attach notifications directly to individual classifiers. Train a tag, author, title keyword, or phrase, and turn on notifications for that specific classifier. Track a specific author across a folder of feeds. Watch for a tag like "layoffs" or "acquisition" across your entire account. Get pinged the moment a story about a competitor shows up anywhere in your subscriptions. Classifier notifications work at every scope: per-feed, per-folder, or global across all your feeds.

These classifiers now come in three flavors. Standard classifiers match exact tags, authors, and keywords. Regex classifiers let you write patterns like `\bCVE-\d{4}-\d+\b` to catch any CVE identifier, or `iPhone|iPad|MacBook` to track multiple products in a single classifier. And natural language classifiers let you describe what you're looking for in plain English, like "stories about startup funding rounds over $50M" or "any mention of regulatory action against tech companies." All three types can have notifications attached.

On their own, classifier notifications are already useful. But on Pro, where every feed is checked every 5 minutes, they become something else entirely. Create a natural language classifier for exactly the kind of story you're watching for, attach a notification, and within minutes of that story appearing in any of your feeds, you have a push notification on your phone. That's the difference between knowing about something the same day and knowing about it the same hour. If you're already using classifier notifications on Premium Archive, Pro is what makes them fast enough for real monitoring.

### Follow up to 10,000 sites

Pro raises the feed limit to 10,000. Premium supports 1,024 sites, Premium Archive supports 4,096, and Pro takes it to 10,000. If you need comprehensive coverage across industries, beats, competitors, or research domains, this is the ceiling you've been looking for.

### Everything in Archive, included

Pro includes the full <a href="https://newsblur.com/pricing/archive">Premium Archive</a> feature set. That means every story archived and searchable forever, Ask AI for answering questions about stories, full-text content training, global and folder-scoped intelligence training, per-feed auto-mark-read timers, and more. Pro adds speed and precision on top of that foundation.

You also get priority support, so when you need help, you're at the front of the line.

### Pricing

Premium Pro is $29/month. It's monthly rather than yearly because the high-frequency fetching infrastructure costs more to operate. You're paying for dedicated polling of up to 10,000 feeds every 5 minutes. If your work depends on being the first to know, Pro pays for itself.

You can upgrade from the <a href="https://newsblur.com/?next=premium">Premium page</a> on the web. If you have feedback or ideas for Pro, I'd love to hear them on the <a href="https://forum.newsblur.com">NewsBlur forum</a>.
