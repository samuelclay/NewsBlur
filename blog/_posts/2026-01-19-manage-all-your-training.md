Over the years I've trained NewsBlur on hundreds of authors, tags, and titles across dozens of feeds. But when I wanted to review what I'd trained, I had to open each feed's trainer individually and click through them one by one. That's fine when you're training a new feed, but it's tedious when you want to see the big picture of all your training.

Today I'm launching the Manage Training tab, a consolidated view of every classifier you've ever trained, organized by folder. You can see everything at a glance, edit inline, and save changes across multiple feeds in a single click.

### How it works

Open the Intelligence Trainer from the sidebar menu (or press the `t` key). You'll now see two tabs at the top: "Site by Site" and "Manage Training".

The Site by Site tab is the existing trainer you know—it walks you through each feed showing authors, tags, and titles you can train. That's still the best way to train new feeds with lots of suggestions.

The Manage Training tab shows only what you've already trained. Every thumbs up and thumbs down you've ever given, organized by folder just like your feed list. Each feed shows its trained classifiers as pills you can click to toggle.

### Filtering made easy

The real power comes from the filtering options. At the top of the tab you'll find several ways to narrow down your training:

**Folder/Site dropdown** — Only folders and sites with training appear in this dropdown. Select a folder to see all training within it, or select a specific site to focus on just that feed's classifiers. This is especially useful when you have hundreds of trained items and want to review just one area.

**Instant search** — Type in the search box and results filter as you type. Search matches against classifier names, feed titles, and folder names. Looking for everything you've trained about "apple"? Just type it and see all matches instantly.

**Likes and Dislikes** — Toggle between All, Likes only, or Dislikes only. Want to see everything you've marked as disliked? One click shows you all the red thumbs-down items across your entire training history.

**Type filters** — Filter by classifier type: Title, Author, Tag, Text, or Site. These are multi-select, so you can show just Authors and Tags while hiding everything else. Perfect for when you want to audit just the authors you've trained across all your feeds.

### Edit inline and save in bulk

Click any classifier pill to toggle it between like, dislike, and neutral. The Save button shows exactly how many changes you've made, so you always know what's pending. Made a mistake? Just click again to undo—the count updates automatically.

When you click Save, all your changes across all feeds are saved in a single request. No more clicking through feeds one at a time to clean up old training.

### Why this matters

The Intelligence Trainer is one of NewsBlur's most powerful features, but it's only useful if you can manage what you've trained. Now you can:

- **Audit your training**: See at a glance which feeds you've trained heavily and which need attention
- **Clean up old training**: Remove classifiers that no longer make sense after a feed changed focus
- **Find specific items**: Search and filter to quickly locate any classifier you've set
- **Fix mistakes**: Quickly find and correct classifiers you set incorrectly

The Manage Training tab is available now on the web. If you have feedback or ideas for improvements, please share them on the <a href="https://forum.newsblur.com">NewsBlur forum</a>.
