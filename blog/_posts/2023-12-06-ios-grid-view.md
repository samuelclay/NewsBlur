The Grid view is now on iOS. Read stories with large thumbnails in a magazine-like format, where you can see a customizable number of story previews at once. Works beautifully for both iPhone and iPad.

Just like on the web, you can customize how many stories you see and how large each story is, giving you the freedom to read stories with large thumbnails or small image previews.

It even works on iPhone!

If you have any other ideas you'd like to see on iPad and iPhone, feel free to post an idea on the <a href="https://forum.newsblur.com">NewsBlur Forum</a>.

This is a huge release and has been a year in the making. Coming up soon: a new Mac app and intelligent feed discovery.
