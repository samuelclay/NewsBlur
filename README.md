## About

NewsBlur is a personal news reader with intelligence. It's an RSS feed reader and social news network that shows the original site while giving you powerful filtering tools. Train NewsBlur to learn what you like and dislike, and it will automatically highlight and hide stories.

NewsBlur is free to use at [newsblur.com](https://www.newsblur.com) (up to 64 sites) with premium plans available, or you can self-host your own instance using this repository.

## Technology

NewsBlur is a Django application (Python 3.7+) with a Backbone.js frontend. It uses:

- PostgreSQL for relational data (feeds, subscriptions, accounts)
- MongoDB for stories and read states
- Redis for story assembly and caching
- Elasticsearch for search (optional)
- Celery for background tasks (feed fetching)
- Node.js services for text extraction and image processing

## Self-Hosted Installation

This repository contains everything you need to run your own NewsBlur instance with complete control over your data.

**Prerequisites**: Docker and Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur.git
cd NewsBlur
make
```

Visit `https://localhost` (type `thisisunsafe` to bypass the self-signed certificate warning).

**Common commands:**
- `make` - Start/update and apply migrations (run after `git pull`)
- `make log` - View web and node logs
- `make logall` - View all container logs
- `make shell` - Django shell with auto-imported models
- `make bash` - Bash shell in web container
- `make test` - Run tests
- `make lint` - Format code (isort, black, flake8)
- `make down` - Stop containers

**Bootstrap discover feeds (without fetching):**

```bash
docker exec -t newsblur_web python manage.py bootstrap_popular_feeds --skip-fetch
```

This creates `PopularFeed` records from the curated fixtures file without fetching any feed content. You can filter by type with `--type youtube`, `--type reddit`, `--type podcast`, `--type newsletter`, or `--type rss`.

**Database access:**
- `make mongo` - MongoDB shell
- `make redis` - Redis CLI
- `make postgres` - PostgreSQL shell

See `AGENTS.md` for detailed development guidelines.

### Configuration

To customize your NewsBlur installation, create `newsblur_web/local_settings.py` to override settings from [`docker_local_settings.py`](newsblur_web/docker_local_settings.py).

**Settings for self-hosted installations:**

- `NEWSBLUR_URL` - Your domain (default: `https://localhost`). Also used for Archive browser extension OAuth.
- `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` - Cookie domain for authentication
- `AUTO_PREMIUM` - Give new users premium features (default: `True`)
- `AUTO_ENABLE_NEW_USERS` - Auto-activate new accounts (default: `True`)
- `ENFORCE_SIGNUP_CAPTCHA` - Require captcha on signup (default: `False`)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - AI features and Discover for related stories
- `DAYS_OF_UNREAD` - Story retention for premium users in days (default: `30`)
- `DAYS_OF_UNREAD_FREE` - Story retention for free users in days (default: `14`)
- `HOMEPAGE_USERNAME` - Username shown on homepage to unauthenticated users (default: `"popular"`)

**Uncommon settings (for running full newsblur.com):**

- `EMAIL_BACKEND` - Email delivery method
- `STRIPE_SECRET` / `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE` - Stripe payment processing
- `PAYPAL_API_CLIENTID` / `PAYPAL_API_SECRET` - PayPal payment processing
- `S3_*` settings - AWS S3 bucket configuration for backups, icons, avatars
- `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` / `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY` / `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` - Social API keys

See the full list in [`docker_local_settings.py`](https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/blob/master/newsblur_web/docker_local_settings.py) and [`settings.py`](https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/blob/master/newsblur_web/settings.py).

## Development with Worktrees

NewsBlur supports Git worktrees for working on multiple features simultaneously, with each worktree running on its own set of ports. This is ideal when working with AI coding assistants like Claude Code.

**Create and start a worktree:**

```bash
git worktree add .worktree/feature-name
cd .worktree/feature-name
make worktree
```

Each worktree automatically gets unique ports based on its directory name:
- Main repo: `https://localhost` (ports 80/443)
- Worktree: `https://localhost:XXXX` (unique ports)

**View your worktree's URLs:**

```bash
make worktree
```

**Follow the worktree logs:**

```bash
make worktree-log
```

**Close a worktree:**

```bash
make worktree-close  # Stops containers and removes worktree if no uncommitted changes
```

All worktrees share the same database services (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch), so you can test multiple features without duplicating data.

## MCP Server & CLI

NewsBlur includes an [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) that lets AI agents (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client) interact with your feeds, stories, and classifiers. Premium subscription required.

### Connect

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http newsblur https://newsblur.com/mcp/
```

**Codex:** Add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:
```toml
[mcp_servers.newsblur]
url = "https://newsblur.com/mcp"
```

On first use, a browser window opens for you to log in to NewsBlur and authorize access.

### What you can do

**Read your feeds** - Get unread stories from any feed or folder, search across all subscriptions, retrieve saved stories by tag.

**Take action** - Mark stories as read, save stories with tags and notes, subscribe to new feeds, share stories to your blurblog.

**Train intelligence** - View and update classifiers to like/dislike authors, tags, titles, and feeds. Let an AI agent analyze your reading patterns and suggest training rules.

**Discover** - Find new feeds by topic, see trending feeds, find feeds similar to ones you already follow.
