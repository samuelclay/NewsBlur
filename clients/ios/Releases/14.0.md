# NewsBlur Version 14.0 Release Notes #


A reverse-chronological list of changes for this major version and its bug-fix releases.

Note: changes apply to both iOS and Mac editions, unless otherwise noted.


## Version 14.0 (build TBD) ##

- Added a NewsBlur Dashboard at the top of the feeds list. Selecting it shows lists of stories that are updated every five minutes, so you can watch news arrive throughout the day. The displayed feeds can be added, removed, changed, and rearranged. Select a feed to show all of that feed, or an individual story to jump to that story.
- Can now pinch an image in a story to zoom to a Quick Look of the full-sized image.
- Added a List view of stories, similar to the Grid view but with rows of stories.
- Added a Magazine view of stories, with taller rows of stories and larger image thumbnails.
- The Mark Story Read preference now has options to mark a story read on scroll or selection, only selection, after an interval, or manually.
- If not marking read on scroll, a button now appears at the end of the story list to mark all stories as read.
- Plus some minor improvements, including:
    - Adjusted grid font sizes to better match the list layout.
    - Adjusted the position of a couple of popover menus on Mac.
    - Improvements to the highlighting of section headings in the sites list sidebar.
