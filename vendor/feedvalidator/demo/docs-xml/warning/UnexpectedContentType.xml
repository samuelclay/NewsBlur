<p>Feeds should not be served with the '<i>foo</i>' media type</p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>The web server is reporting an unexpected MIME type for a feed.
Although we tried to parse it as a feed, aggregators may well report this
as an error and act as if the user had pointed them at something other than
a feed.</p>
<p>RSS feeds should be served as <code>application/rss+xml</code>
(RSS 1.0 is an RDF format, so it may be served as
<code>application/rdf+xml</code> instead).
Atom feeds should use <code>application/atom+xml</code>.
Alternatively, for compatibility with widely-deployed web browsers, any of
these feeds can use one of the more
general XML types -  preferably <code>application/xml</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Use the appropriate MIME type for your feed.</p>
<ul>
<li>For static content served with Apache, use the 
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_mime.html#addtype">AddType</a>
directive.</li>
<li>For static content served with Microsoft IIS,
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/WindowsServ/2003/all/deployguide/en-us/Default.asp?url=/resources/documentation/WindowsServ/2003/all/deployguide/en-us/iisdg_dep_wzvf.asp">add a MIME type</a>.</li>
<li>Other information can be found
<a href="http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTTP-charset">here</a> or in the documentation provided by your server.</li>
