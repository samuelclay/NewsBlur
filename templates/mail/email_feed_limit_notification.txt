{% block body %}Hi {{ username }},

I'm reaching out because your NewsBlur account has {{ feed_count }} active sites, and I wanted to give you a heads up about an upcoming change.

To help balance server load and keep NewsBlur running smoothly for everyone, Premium subscriptions now include up to 1,024 sites. Premium Archive subscriptions include up to 4,096 sites.

On {{ deadline_date }}, when your subscription renews, you'll need to choose one of these options:

  1. Upgrade to Premium Archive ($99/year) - This includes up to 4,096 sites, plus full-text search and access to your complete story archive. You can upgrade here: https://newsblur.com/?next=premium

  2. Choose which 1,024 sites to keep active - You can use the Mute Sites feature to select which sites you want to continue following.

Until then, nothing changes for you. All {{ feed_count }} of your sites will continue working normally.

Thanks for being a long-time NewsBlur subscriber. I really appreciate your support.

- Samuel{% endblock body %}
