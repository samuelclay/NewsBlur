    <h2 style="color: #282F33; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Hi {{ username }},</h2>

    <p style="line-height: 20px;">I'm reaching out because your NewsBlur account has <b>{{ feed_count }}</b> active sites, and I wanted to give you a heads up about an upcoming change.</p>

    <p style="line-height: 20px;">To help balance server load and keep NewsBlur running smoothly for everyone, Premium subscriptions now include up to 1,024 sites. Premium Archive subscriptions include up to 4,096 sites.</p>

    <p style="line-height: 20px;">On <b>{{ deadline_date }}</b>, when your subscription renews, you'll need to choose one of these options:</p>

    <ol style="line-height: 24px; margin-left: 20px;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><b>Upgrade to Premium Archive ($99/year)</b> - This includes up to 4,096 sites, plus full-text search and access to your complete story archive.<br><a href="https://newsblur.com/?next=premium" style="color: #1251ba;">Upgrade now</a></li>
        <li><b>Choose which 1,024 sites to keep active</b> - You can use the Mute Sites feature to select which sites you want to continue following.</li>
    </ol>

    <p style="line-height: 20px;">Until then, nothing changes for you. All {{ feed_count }} of your sites will continue working normally.</p>

    <p style="line-height: 20px;">Thanks for being a long-time NewsBlur subscriber. I really appreciate your support.</p>

    <p style="line-height: 20px;">- Samuel</p>
