# These wonderful quotes are Truisms, all written by Jenny Holzer.
# It is important to note that a few of these are commented out,
# it is not because they are wrong, just that they may be considered
# controversial. I'd rather err on the side of safety, which is contrary
# to the trusim: "playing it safe can cause a lot of damage in the long run".

# We'll see where this goes. This is an experiment. - Sam, July 6th, 2012
